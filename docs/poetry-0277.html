                    <p>The best kind of trouble is the trouble you create for yourself,</p>
                    <p>there is no limit to how elaborate of a problem you can invent.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Relativity and contrast play a very important role here,</p>
                    <p>the lower you are and the higher you aim the more it is worth the trouble.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is safe to say that a nice and comfortable bed with an electric blanket,</p>
                    <p>on a quiet and sleepy afternoon is a pretty good low.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A pretty good height to reach is either ten miles by foot,</p>
                    <p>or 1,500 miles by car where it usually involves a beach somewhere.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Moreover, you need a team deadline, a snooze button, a soon to end semester,</p>
                    <p>and an ungrateful team where you do all the work, add a few bullies...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>and your co-worker whispering:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did she get a raise, she doesn&apos;t know anything&quot; - emphasizing &quot;she doesn&apos;t know&quot;.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>While not purrfect, this is a really good start,</p>
                    <p>and erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,</p>
                    <p>and a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>See, you are not just headed for Key West and back,</p>
                    <p>I m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,</p>
                    <p>it is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,</p>
                    <p>they are usually there because something beautiful is going on.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>You never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,</p>
                    <p>it could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Personally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,</p>
                    <p>but it is fine for a woman.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And you certainly don&apos;t want to realize come your late golden age,</p>
                    <p>that you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Now, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,</p>
                    <p>to wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>An hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,</p>
                    <p>it won&apos;t be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,</p>
                    <p>how nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,</p>
                    <p>there is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,</p>
                    <p>and do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger&apos;s road - that ain&apos;t good.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Eventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,</p>
                    <p>and stop at the next park.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,</p>
                    <p>you can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Now, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,</p>
                    <p>be good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won&apos;t last long at all.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Don&apos;t make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,</p>
                    <p>and figured why don&apos;t I use a pencil at first...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>...smart right?</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,</p>
                    <p>treat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If you want to speak at length,</p>
                    <p>do what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Healing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound &quot;dumb&quot; to you after a bit,</p>
                    <p>but that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A lot of people will stay in bed,</p>
                    <p>they will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,</p>
                    <p>she could then come around and tell them &quot;Hey! you will never get a raise again?&quot;, that could still snap them out of it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But, if the boss is not fully crazed,</p>
                    <p>you are their last hope.</p>

                    <p>The trouble you go through to learn to jog,</p>
                    <p>or try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>As all end of the road towns are tourist traps,</p>
                    <p>so, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Except maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,</p>
                    <p>very few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Yeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,</p>
                    <p>to all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.</p>

                    <p>No human should lead the life of a house cat,</p>

                    <p>One, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,</p>
                    <p>it was clearly the husband&apos;s idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,</p>
                    <p>and not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,</p>
                    <p>now the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,</p>
                    <p>and thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Between the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.</p>
                    <p>That this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They stayed the weekend,</p>
                    <p>but they needed at least three weeks if not months.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They needed to stop racing forward,</p>
                    <p>they needed more adventures, more &quot;inconvenience&quot;, more trouble-making as I call it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>That woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,</p>
                    <p>she had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.</p>

                    <p>See emanated the mana that bespoke that,</p>
                    <p>the standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Anyway, still a glorious couple,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">You really are a genius,
we are all super smart.
There are lots of tools,
that people use to create.
For example,
poetry has rhyming dictionaries.
Painting and drawing,
has art projectors that help with proportions.
In the world of sculpture,
some use three dimensional pantographs.
Music composition,
has tools like piano roll and sequencer to make composition easy.
Even abstract mathematics, physics, or elliptic curve cryptography,
is only intimidating until you find all the visualizations, introductory books and lectures.
People make complicated things seem like a big deal,
because they want to be seen as special.
Someone who really does enjoy some complex subject,
would be more than happy, to help others learn.
Sharing knowledge,
is a wonderful feeling.
Isn&apos;t that the point of why we learn,
it sure seems like it.
One of the most important things about learning,
is that you start with something that that is interesting for you.
You don&apos;t have to stick with it forever,
just until you find something more interesting.
It is really important that you know how super-smart you are,
and that it is best to learn at your own pace and in a sequence that matches your existing knowledge best.
We are all great dreamers and great artists,
great geniuses full of countless ideas.

                  <span class="text-muted">We are each a miracle of Cosmos,
and each day is a gift.
Life is not short, life is so long,
that you are going to forget a bunch a stuff, and not care.
But it is possible to run in circles;
pretend to learn, work hard at a job you hate, and never really grow up.
It is easy to avoid this,
we just need to listen to some deeply fascinating and inspiring audio books on a long, beautiful and healthy adventure.
But also, we can&apos;t really return from the adventure,
we have to continue climbing at the same of better angle that the adventure pushed us into.
That is what growing is,
we never go back to little things, we always go forward to the greater things.
For example, the moment I help yo understand that school is robbing you of creativity,
that cramming and memorizing is just acting and not learning, you have to aim higher, and learn for real.
You can go back to school,
but you can only treat it as a game.
Know that you are not getting an education, and the curricula are going to be all over the place, and you&apos;ll just spin in circles merely exercising your temporary memory,
you are unlikely to be inheriting knowledge and components of wisdom from great beings, onward to becoming wise, and eventually speaking out as a Great Being.
School is not going to teach you that,
you will still need a real education.
And although life is very long,
it is still worrisome that someone should sink several years towards an unknown, a goal set in childhood.
Charles Bukowski, who does not mince words, asks this terrible question,
about the morning routine - and I quote:
&quot;How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock,
leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, s*it, p*ss, brush teeth and hair,
and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?&quot;
Furthermore, Henry Thoreau, or Socrates reminds us,
that we need to know what life is, and the following quote is from Walden.
&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life,
and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;
nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.
I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,
to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,
to cut a broad swath and shave close,
to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&quot;
These are great beings, they are immortal, full of wisdom and knowledge,
it is really important to - if not befriend them - then to at least answer their questions.
Like I said, life is so long that you are going to forget a bunch of years,
and not even feel bad about it.
But lowering ourselves into a decades long routine,
that we may kind of regret later on, is not good.
While life is long,
we don&apos;t get a do over, so we have to make sure that we are headed towards a good and healthy future, an authentic future.
All I am saying, is that you must carefully examine life,
because there are too many people out there that will try to take advantage of your inexperience.
By examining life, by listening to great beings with large libraries of experiences, mistakes, failures and triumphs,
you will learn from their life, and get a really good idea of where you really want to be.
And more than that,
you can take multiple paths.
For example become a writer and a poet, first; and then go back to Med School after you crossed the Appalachian Trail a couple of times,
and after you fought some Angry Bears and Mountain Lions with little more than Courage and some sharp Nail Clippers.</span>

if it was easy somebody else would have done it already.
Next time you&apos;re in class, look at the back row,
one of them is a genius who does not believe in the world anymore, the rest need help, the sooner the better.
I know you can prevent them from fracturing,
I know you have it in you to save the world.
All around the world, liars stretch accepted patterns they hardly understand, like a bubble gum, and with perfect deniability,
there is no blame, there is no proof, there are no laws that could help here, nothing can be done to fix anything.
But also nothing that Humanity needs,
has been lost permanently.
The state of things as we see today,
can be prevented from re-occurring come next-generation by means of real education, and prevention of emergence of desperate creatures that become perfect liars.
The same goes for criminals,
the idea of stealing an ATM to become free comes from little more than Saturday morning cartoons and desperation.
With real politics and wise politicians, we will see Universal Basic Income come into reality,
and nobody is going to rob anything if they already have the money and live a life of Knowledge, Authenticity, and Dignity.
As unbelievable as it sounds, Prevention coupled with Real Education,
that guides people towards Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness, is where Humanity will find its future.
Once liars take to power, we can only wait for them to retire,
and while we are waiting we have to help children grow so that they will become the Great Beings that will may their place.</span>

you are more than the endless universe will ever be able to comprehend.
You can&apos;t just act like everyone else,
because that is not worthy of you.
You are nothing-like the mix that fits all,
you are a unique-and-blinding beauty.
And you do underestimate yourself,
it will take you a lot of distance, to get to know who you are.
You can learn a lot about your height in the universe,
when an unexpected storm approaches, and all you have is a tent.
That big storm is not interested in you,
and you have to learn to get along with nature.
In the raw beauty of it all,
a good adventure book makes all the difference.
That unfiltered nature, thunder,
or snow, or hard rain, or even a beautiful breeze in the woods...
Ad a place where you can truly hear,
the words of a Philosopher or an Adventurer is something else.
All the Philosophers are asking us to examine life,
to be authentic, to walk our own trail and then keep pushing forward.
Because that is how they rose,,
that&apos;s what made them into great, unique and timeless beings.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">There is little to stop life&apos;s misfortunes from happening,
but we can learn to face them in great dignity.
All misfortunes can be conquered with wisdom,
the act of rising from misfortunes grants our life a greater meaning.
With what we learn we can spare others the same pains,
thusly making our own aches count for more.
If all we have, to deal with great challenges,
is a diploma and a career, than that will not be enough for us.
We need enough wisdom in our soul or the content of our character,
to become in-compressible, and unbreakable.
Life must go on, we must rise against all odds,
no evil, no meaningless suffering, no liar is to hold us down.
The most powerful part of us that drives all the rest,
is wisdom.
Wisdom is like a flower, and it grows within books,
whatever our challenge, great beings faced similar circumstance.
And so that their aches did not get lost,
they turned them into wisdom, and the only way to reliably share wisdom is books.
A well narrated book can give a person great strength in a very short time,
and when our soul hurts the most our mind becomes extremely receptive to wisdom.
It is best, I think, to read books, or listen to their narrated versions,
ahead of time.
Books also enhance our decision making,
so that we may avoid hopelessness altogether.
The only thing that can give us great trouble,
is not having access to well respected and meaningful books that change lives with wisdom.
Because then we will need to rebuild the path to greatness from zero,
and that may take decades if not more.
There is a problem with books because reading them is not the best way to inherit their wisdom,
the best way is to have them beautifully read to us.
Not only that but in order to hear the narrator well,
we need a healthy mind and a balanced existence, a kind of a long and hard vacation.
We need the healing power of nature, of hills, trees, moss and fern,
little woodland springs, an occasional beach, warm nights and fragrant mornings.
To understand a book, you need a fine narrator, and thick smell of pine trees,
a cracking bonfire or cabin fireplace, and the certainty of knowing that you have tomorrow for yourself as well.
We are unable to inherit knowledge from books when our life is stressful,
in stress the best we can do is temporary memorize.
But we have to appreciate the content of what is being said,
not merely the words themselves, but the birth and life of the idea behind them.
Learning requires the creation of a map or scaffold,
and that can only be built when we love ourselves.
And once wisdom finally takes root within us, it cannot be removed in any way, wisdom grows, almost on its own,
it grants us solutions to new problems by subtle analogy to that which we already understand.
And wisdom spreads, it is hard not to share good ideas,
and it is hard to stop them from being shared.
Once equipped with wisdom,
we can hear the chains of misfortune dragging a mile away, and we are, in a way, ready.
We stand with the many others that we met in books, but now creating a family in time and space,
and now we fully appreciate their struggles and eventual triumph, and them taking the time to share their hard won wisdom.
And then we rise, we rise out of it all,
in our struggle wisdom will bloom within us multiplying our strengths to no end.
Later in life we will be able to heal others,
help them with their thoughts and towards their own synthesis of wisdom, and helping them to become just as unbreakable.</span>
