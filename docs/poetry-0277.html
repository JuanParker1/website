                    <p>The best kind of trouble is the trouble you create for yourself,</p>
                    <p>there is no limit to how elaborate of a problem you can invent.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Relativity and contrast play a very important role here,</p>
                    <p>the lower you are and the higher you aim the more it is worth the trouble.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is safe to say that a nice and comfortable bed with an electric blanket,</p>
                    <p>on a quiet and sleepy afternoon is a pretty good low.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A pretty good height to reach is either ten miles by foot,</p>
                    <p>or 1,500 miles by car where it usually involves a beach somewhere.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Moreover, you need a team deadline, a snooze button, a soon to end semester,</p>
                    <p>and an ungrateful team where you do all the work, add a few bullies...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>and your co-worker whispering:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did she get a raise, she doesn&apos;t know anything&quot; - emphasizing &quot;she doesn&apos;t know&quot;.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>While not purrfect, this is a really good start,</p>
                    <p>and erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,</p>
                    <p>and a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>See, you are not just headed for Key West and back,</p>
                    <p>I m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,</p>
                    <p>it is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,</p>
                    <p>they are usually there because something beautiful is going on.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>You never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,</p>
                    <p>it could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Personally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,</p>
                    <p>but it is fine for a woman.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And you certainly don&apos;t want to realize come your late golden age,</p>
                    <p>that you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Now, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,</p>
                    <p>to wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>An hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,</p>
                    <p>it won&apos;t be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,</p>
                    <p>how nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,</p>
                    <p>there is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,</p>
                    <p>and do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger&apos;s road - that ain&apos;t good.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Eventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,</p>
                    <p>and stop at the next park.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,</p>
                    <p>you can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Now, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,</p>
                    <p>be good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won&apos;t last long at all.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Don&apos;t make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,</p>
                    <p>and figured why don&apos;t I use a pencil at first...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>...smart right?</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,</p>
                    <p>treat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If you want to speak at length,</p>
                    <p>do what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Healing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound &quot;dumb&quot; to you after a bit,</p>
                    <p>but that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A lot of people will stay in bed,</p>
                    <p>they will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,</p>
                    <p>she could then come around and tell them &quot;Hey! you will never get a raise again?&quot;, that could still snap them out of it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But, if the boss is not fully crazed,</p>
                    <p>you are their last hope.</p>

                    <p>The trouble you go through to learn to jog,</p>
                    <p>or try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>As all end of the road towns are tourist traps,</p>
                    <p>so, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Except maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,</p>
                    <p>very few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Yeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,</p>
                    <p>to all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.</p>

                    <p>No human should lead the life of a house cat,</p>
                    <p>we are very dynamic, and doing beautiful unusual things helps us stay healthy.</p>

                    <p>One, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,</p>
                    <p>it was clearly the husband&apos;s idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,</p>
                    <p>and not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,</p>
                    <p>now the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,</p>
                    <p>and thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Between the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.</p>
                    <p>That this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They stayed the weekend,</p>
                    <p>but they needed at least three weeks if not months.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They needed to stop racing forward,</p>
                    <p>they needed more adventures, more &quot;inconvenience&quot;, more trouble-making as I call it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>That woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,</p>
                    <p>she had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>See emanated the mana that bespoke that,</p>
                    <p>the standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Anyway, still a glorious couple,</p>

it is for you so that you may live a beautiful and meaningful life.
It cannot be sold or rented,
because it is priceless.
Nor, can you give it away,
under any circumstance.
Everybody that has something to gain,
will try to push you to work past your limit.
You can&apos;t allow that,
your life is not meant to be spent on work.
You should only work enough,
so that you are safe.
It is hard to keep a balanced existence,
but we must always search and never give in.
We are not machines, nor cogs in one,
we are Music, Poetry, Great Thinker and Dreamers.
We have to protect what makes us beautiful,
overwork can only prevent us from fixing the world.
We are each meant to become well-read,
knowledgeable, wise and an outspoken inspiration to many.
The younger generations are always in need of Great Teachers,
as they all to easily accept the status quo.
All the world nations require great improvement,
and to change the world, we can only rely on Wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Might is meant for battle only,
when battles end, we must return to balance.
Life is meant to revolve around cheerfulness,
or sweet mischief if you are one of those.
It is fueled by knowledge,
driven by wisdom, all towards greatness.
It matters that we are good to ourselves,
that we care about our body and mind.
Some battles such as World Peace,
can&apos;t yet be fought, and we must not try.
If something is too big,
then it will take our cheerfulness and life away.
There is much in the world that needs repair,
but first the world must become wiser.
Before a battle for World Peace is fought,
we must repair schools.
And before we take to repairing schools,
we must first speak out about what is wrong with them.
The wiser our approach to such great endeavors,
the more you will see that it calls for clear thinking.
And clear thinking cannot come,
out of an unbalanced mind.
It requires peace, and cheerfulness, the sun and the moon,
ocean sunshine, snowy adventures, and fragrant woods.
We must be kind to ourselves,
as in haste of might, all our life may pass us by.
And so I offer a small purrsciption,
to ensure that you are forever well.
Above all,
slow down.
Ensure that have time to listen to an audio book each week,
the book need not be long but it must be fascinating.
Prepare a tent and a backpack for this summer,
even if it is just for camping in your backyard.
Get a Mini Projector to trace photos on canvas,
and get some good watercolors, oils or pencils to begin study art.
And to keep heath, search the internet for Dance Tutorials,
and let the music move your body.
You can be sure that you live in balance within your self,
when you have time for self improvement and keeping healthy.
If this is something that you can&apos;t do,
then you must learn to love yourself more, and try harder.
Your health and the way you treat yourself in life,
must be the first and foremost concern.
Because, if you can&apos;t or don&apos;t care about yourself,
then many others will be too scared to care for you.
Haste and Might are handy,
but just for a little while.
Balance, Creativity, Peace, and Health,
is how life is meant to be lived.
Do not be scared to switch majors, or carers, or continents,
be good to yourself, strive to be cheerful.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Learn and make haste slowly,
examine life in search for wisdom.
When someone pulls you,
stand your ground.
When someone frightens you,
leave.
You will find no answers,
except, for one place.
Call it the Library,
Books, Video Lectures, or Audio Books.
The only people that deliver Components of Wisdom,
are the authors of top selling non-fiction.
Schools and Nations,
are overwhelmed.
Clogged with uneducated pretenders,
incapable of vision.
They proclaim World Peace,
to be stupid.
And parade Mutually Assured Destruction,
instead.
Grow strong and free,
and learn to no end.
Nobody is coming,
to deliver wisdom unto you.
You!
have to go get the books yourself.
Do not wait,
your knowledge dictates all your decisions.
There are too many liars,
too much mediocrity.
Too much hidden in plain sight,
beneath a shroud of inaction.
The quest for World Peace,
is in your hands now.
The Great Search for Wisdom and Greatness,
awaits you.
Please,
do not delay.
For you are meant to become
a Great Being.
You are to lead the change,
the little ones will soon hope for.
In an incomplete world,
we can&apos;t rest.
Rise for Education, Truth, Peace,
Equality, Freedom and Justice.
The future now begs that all children
are taught to become Great Beings.
May the World grow,
with Knowledge, Love, Wisdom, and Foresight.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">The educational shortcut,
is always a lie.
The only thing we will find in a shortcut,
is a fantasy or fairy tale, an impression of education, or make-believe success.
There is really no need to take shortcuts in life,
learning and growing up is beautiful.
Growing up, is an act of endless tiny adventures,
as you pursue your little curiosities onward to wisdom.
Most adventures are very poetic, adventures in spirit so to speak,
such as learning to paint low-brow art with oil on canvas, whilst listening to Kenji Kawai.
Many adventures are actual expeditions that involve backpacks and sometimes even tents,
it still counts, when you only camp in your backyard; an adventure is an adventure.
The more advanced art of listening to audio books when hiking through a little wilderness,
is so pleasant, so relaxing and educational that no one should want to skip it.
When books are read to us,
we really connect with what the author is saying.
Reading books with our own inner-voice, is not perfect because we bring in our own worries and tone,
the book is always tethered down with what is going on in our life and what comes tomorrow.
Books are stories that must be told with passion,
and by an external voice, with some approval from the author; if not the author her self.
It is not possible to walk through the woods, and sticks and roots,
and read a book in such a way that we can hear the author try to teach us wisdom.
Yes, it is important that we walk through green valleys and fragrant woodlands,
it is not the same to listen to a book in the busy streets of a city full of strangers.
Nature has a very powerful impact on us,
it makes us slow down, it makes us calmer, we sleep at sunset and awake at sun rise.
Without fears, distractions, and the hurry of the busy life,
books begin fitting into our lifestyle as our heart begins to call for wisdom.
Nature and Books are opposite of shortcuts, they
create very long and wise lives.
This is a lifestyle of learning and growing up,
it cannot hurt us, it can only make us better, and it will spare us mistakes.
In this kind of life,
no one will push you to hurry up.
No one will frighten you, or lie to you,
here you just cheerfully move at your own speed.
Always thinking,
and always learning, always growing up.
In the life that we are all expected to live,
people lie when they say college will grant you a successful career.
Only you can guarantee yourself a successful career,
and you have to start very early, maybe as early as middle-school.
You have to begin thinking about co-founding a series of tiny companies
that will help you learn about business, and what it means to be a leader, a founder, and a CEO.
You have to discover and follow your passions,
and further your inventions.
Real investors don&apos;t care much for a sales pitch with an elevator cartoon,
they look for genius, passion, sanity, and long therm visions.
On the other hand working for somebody else under several management layers,
does not guarantee a healthy career.
We maybe forced into stress, overwork,
and have all our balance drained from us.
Just because we can work at a breakneck speed,
it does not mean that we should, that kind of lifestyle is very dangerous.
Servitude of this kind will make us age faster,
long after the bosses tried to tell us &quot;life is not fair&quot; we will still suffer from effects of overwork.
We must keep a healthy balance with day and night and nature,
we are not machines, we are poetry.
There are no shortcuts,
and learning is beautiful.
For one you never stop learning, and two; life never stops challenging you,
and three, you must live healthy.
Take good care of your self,
it is the lifetimes of wisdom you inherit from all the books that make the biggest difference.
Life is meant to be lived beautifully and cheerfully;
consciousness is such an impossible gift from the Universe, that without a doubt, you are meant to be happy.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Knowledge has an enormous impact on decision making,
if you don&apos;t know enough you maybe taken advantage of.
You gain knowledge by means of authentic education,
an education that has maximum impact on your existence.
Memorization or cramming is not an authentic education,
it is not any kind of education.
You don&apos;t want to rely on a doctor that memorized everything in school,
professionals must look things up to keep up with changes.
Memorization is only good for two things,
passing tests, and getting you ready for a factory job on an assembly line.
And on the other end, tests are for teachers to keep their jobs,
and principals to keep getting funding.
You have to make sure that you are not getting sold for a money,
that you are not being used to sustain an outdated industry.
And above all, do not let them trick you into thinking yo are not smart,
we are all extremely smart, we are all, without exception extremely good at learning for real.
The problem is with schools, they are trying to use a single teacher,
to teach anywhere between 30 and 300 students.
There is no way that a teacher can handle that,
so they will make up tests so that majority passes and damn the rest.
Memorization is just a temporary circus trick,
make sure you are learning meaningful things that have lasting impact.
Real education will multiply you,
fake education will make a fool out of you.
Decision-making is one of the most important things in life,
we need Real Education, Real Knowledge to help us make correct decisions in life.
Many of the decisions we make early on,
have long term impact that continues for decades in not for life.
It also matters that we grow up in an authentic culture,
if we are surrounded by lairs that too will contribute to push us off the path we want to be on.
You must ask if perhaps the school industry is using outdated teaching methods
that barely worked during industrial revolution, to keep getting government money.
Every student in every country,
from middle school to university must to check if they are really learning for real.
Real education is one that enriches a person with Knowledge gained in previous generations,
real education provides many lifetimes of knowledge in a beautifully arranged bouquet.
In turn, that Knowledge grows in you as its components become your own building blocks,
and help you to become Strong, Happy, Wise, Beautiful,
and eventually help you become a Great Being, one who makes lasting contributions to Human Kind.</span>
