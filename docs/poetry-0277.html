                    <p>The best kind of trouble is the trouble you create for yourself,</p>
                    <p>there is no limit to how elaborate of a problem you can invent.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Relativity and contrast play a very important role here,</p>
                    <p>the lower you are and the higher you aim the more it is worth the trouble.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is safe to say that a nice and comfortable bed with an electric blanket,</p>
                    <p>on a quiet and sleepy afternoon is a pretty good low.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A pretty good height to reach is either ten miles by foot,</p>
                    <p>or 1,500 miles by car where it usually involves a beach somewhere.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Moreover, you need a team deadline, a snooze button, a soon to end semester,</p>
                    <p>and an ungrateful team where you do all the work, add a few bullies...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>and your co-worker whispering:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did she get a raise, she doesn&apos;t know anything&quot; - emphasizing &quot;she doesn&apos;t know&quot;.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>While not purrfect, this is a really good start,</p>
                    <p>and erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,</p>
                    <p>and a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>See, you are not just headed for Key West and back,</p>
                    <p>I m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,</p>
                    <p>it is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,</p>
                    <p>they are usually there because something beautiful is going on.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>You never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,</p>
                    <p>it could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Personally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,</p>
                    <p>but it is fine for a woman.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And you certainly don&apos;t want to realize come your late golden age,</p>
                    <p>that you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Now, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,</p>
                    <p>to wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>An hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,</p>
                    <p>it won&apos;t be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,</p>
                    <p>how nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,</p>
                    <p>there is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,</p>
                    <p>and do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger&apos;s road - that ain&apos;t good.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Eventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,</p>
                    <p>and stop at the next park.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,</p>
                    <p>you can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Now, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,</p>
                    <p>be good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won&apos;t last long at all.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Don&apos;t make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,</p>
                    <p>and figured why don&apos;t I use a pencil at first...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>...smart right?</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,</p>
                    <p>treat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If you want to speak at length,</p>
                    <p>do what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Healing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound &quot;dumb&quot; to you after a bit,</p>
                    <p>but that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A lot of people will stay in bed,</p>
                    <p>they will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,</p>
                    <p>she could then come around and tell them &quot;Hey! you will never get a raise again?&quot;, that could still snap them out of it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But, if the boss is not fully crazed,</p>
                    <p>you are their last hope.</p>

                    <p>The trouble you go through to learn to jog,</p>
                    <p>or try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>As all end of the road towns are tourist traps,</p>
                    <p>so, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Except maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,</p>
                    <p>very few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Yeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,</p>
                    <p>to all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.</p>

                    <p>No human should lead the life of a house cat,</p>
                    <p>we are very dynamic, and doing beautiful unusual things helps us stay healthy.</p>

                    <p>One, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,</p>
                    <p>it was clearly the husband&apos;s idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,</p>
                    <p>and not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,</p>
                    <p>now the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,</p>
                    <p>and thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Between the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.</p>
                    <p>That this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They stayed the weekend,</p>
                    <p>but they needed at least three weeks if not months.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They needed to stop racing forward,</p>
                    <p>they needed more adventures, more &quot;inconvenience&quot;, more trouble-making as I call it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>That woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,</p>
                    <p>she had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>See emanated the mana that bespoke that,</p>
                    <p>the standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Anyway, still a glorious couple,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">There is little to stop life&apos;s misfortunes from happening,
but we can learn to face them in great dignity.
All misfortunes can be conquered with wisdom,
the act of rising from misfortunes grants our life a greater meaning.
With what we learn we can spare others the same pains,
thusly making our own aches count for more.
If all we have, to deal with great challenges,
is a diploma and a career, than that will not be enough for us.
We need enough wisdom in our soul or the content of our character,
to become in-compressible, and unbreakable.
Life must go on, we must rise against all odds,
no evil, no meaningless suffering, no liar is to hold us down.
The most powerful part of us that drives all the rest,
is wisdom.
Wisdom is like a flower, and it grows within books,
whatever our challenge, great beings faced similar circumstance.
And so that their aches did not get lost,
they turned them into wisdom, and the only way to reliably share wisdom is books.
A well narrated book can give a person great strength in a very short time,
and when our soul hurts the most our mind becomes extremely receptive to wisdom.
It is best, I think, to read books, or listen to their narrated versions,
ahead of time.
Books also enhance our decision making,
so that we may avoid hopelessness altogether.
The only thing that can give us great trouble,
is not having access to well respected and meaningful books that change lives with wisdom.
Because then we will need to rebuild the path to greatness from zero,
and that may take decades if not more.
There is a problem with books because reading them is not the best way to inherit their wisdom,
the best way is to have them beautifully read to us.
Not only that but in order to hear the narrator well,
we need a healthy mind and a balanced existence, a kind of a long and hard vacation.
We need the healing power of nature, of hills, trees, moss and fern,
little woodland springs, an occasional beach, warm nights and fragrant mornings.
To understand a book, you need a fine narrator, and thick smell of pine trees,
a cracking bonfire or cabin fireplace, and the certainty of knowing that you have tomorrow for yourself as well.
We are unable to inherit knowledge from books when our life is stressful,
in stress the best we can do is temporary memorize.
But we have to appreciate the content of what is being said,
not merely the words themselves, but the birth and life of the idea behind them.
Learning requires the creation of a map or scaffold,
and that can only be built when we love ourselves.
And once wisdom finally takes root within us, it cannot be removed in any way, wisdom grows, almost on its own,
it grants us solutions to new problems by subtle analogy to that which we already understand.
And wisdom spreads, it is hard not to share good ideas,
and it is hard to stop them from being shared.
Once equipped with wisdom,
we can hear the chains of misfortune dragging a mile away, and we are, in a way, ready.
We stand with the many others that we met in books, but now creating a family in time and space,
and now we fully appreciate their struggles and eventual triumph, and them taking the time to share their hard won wisdom.
And then we rise, we rise out of it all,
in our struggle wisdom will bloom within us multiplying our strengths to no end.
Later in life we will be able to heal others,
help them with their thoughts and towards their own synthesis of wisdom, and helping them to become just as unbreakable.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Life is not meant to frighten you,
it is meant to become your most Beautiful Work Of Art.
Even if we had perfect governments and perfect schools,
and became perfectly educated...
...it would still be better for us all, and the universe,
if you stopped following and begun leading to become the Best You.
Yeah, I guess you can&apos;t be a Doctor then,
but being a Doctor is not as lasting as becoming a Great Being.
A great being can heal entire generations,
reminding them of vision, wisdom, and of importance of an examined life.
Very few professionals can go that far out of their way,
and we all need help with Heart, or Fear, or Answers, and the Art of Existence.
A career will not help you make sense of life,
and there will be many challenges as we progress on.
Is it really that foolish to say that Wisdom should come first,
that we should get a solid grasp on things before setting aims?
I suppose that wisdom takes a relay long time,
but that&apos;s not a good reason to make it second to aims we set in High School.
We all agree that we should all be judged based on the content of our character,
and Knowledge and Wisdom is a pretty good way to make it Beautiful.
And things like Fear, Loneliness, or Sorrow cannot be helped by a career,
no matter how well it pays - being Human always comes first.
Only knowledge and the many components of wisdom contained within us
can help us rise to the great many challenges of life.
Learning to become Knowledgeable and Wise is so wonderful,
we just take our audio books on long winding nature trails, and sandy beaches.
We bring our graphite and drawing notepads, even canvas, acrylics and oils,
and all the questions, that we struggle finding answers to in the midst of haste.
And we learn, on beautiful evenings thick with oxygen, and energizing mornings rich with crisp cool air,
so as long as we have access to books that help us inherit wisdom from countless other lives, so that we need not start at zero - we learn.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">It is not always necessary to accurately map the affairs of the World.
sometimes all you need is a vision of a better one.
The world is difficult to grasp because people in authority,
have interests that differ from, the people that vote on them.
Furthermore, low quality schools,
will prevent the voter from making correct choices.
The uneducated or misled majority,
will always be incorrect.
This is why independent, self education,
be it in addition or as a replacement of the national one is a wise idea.
Independent education is one that is paved with curiosities,
and helped along with top-selling non fiction, including narrated books.
Majority of world&apos;s top selling books
are written by well educated and well meaning authors.
Lack of education breeds desperation,
not only will the voters be confused, but the politicians won&apos;t understand them either.
A world where leaders place their needs above the people they swore to represent,
and do the bare minimum for maximum personal gains, is a world that needs vision.
On the other hand, a well educated, knowledgeable and wise voting majority,
isn&apos;t one to get confused, or become mislead, easily.
A vision is always something that most of humanity has already agreed on,
though they might have forgotten parts here and there, or worded them differently.
For example:
Climate Stabilization
Human Dignity
World Peace
Universal Human Rights
World Disarmament
Functional Education
End Of Poverty All Around The World
Universal Basic Income
World Unity
Justice
Authenticity, and Truth.
As we progress from well-read, to knowledgeable, to wise, and onward to our greatness,
we will collect and hold in our hearts many such Hopes and Dreams.
At first they may seem like words or beautiful ideas,
but as we look into Memoirs, and beloved and honored works of great story tellers, they will become more.
With a few dozen books a concept that has been lost on leaders of humanity,
will come to life in our hearts.
Rather than trying to flawlessly comprehend the world,
which may not be possible due to too many liars who by definition lack in vision, and are merely responding to stimuli for maximum self gain.
We gain the ability hold up several of our most beloved Aims, Hopes and Dreams,
and ask what are the leaders doing to fulfill them.
It is much easier to look at a leader&apos;s sum of history,
and notice that they have never done anything meaningful for World Peace and Elimination of Poverty, than to await their promises to come true.
We can then ask, if we want to vote on people who do not recognize World Peace and Elimination of Poverty as an aim,
and what those people must be like.
More importantly, holding a meaningful vision helps us grow up stronger and faster,
helps us focus our energies and curiosities on things that we become passionate about.
When a wise voting majority becomes passionate about Human Dignity,
the strength that arises from Unity of Vision can easily repair World&apos;s Nations and help Humanity Grow.
Without a wise consensus things that are concurring around the world are probably mostly random,
with elections won by those who spend most money on taking on a pleasing shape, and disasters being a predictable result of corruption and shortsightedness.
It is hard to blame leaders and voters for something as disabling as lack of education,
people who lack knowledge pave their ways with their best intentions, alas Humanity&apos;s most beloved works of non-fiction must come first, lest we continue repeating the same old mistakes.
There is nothing difficult
about falling in love with Good Ideas,
When we take to Adventures and Books, and a new book surprises us with a like selection of Hopes and Dreams,
we can only discover how connected we all really are, that we are in fact one big family.
What are your Hopes and Dreams?
What is your Vision of The Future Of Humanity?</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">The legacy you commit to the pages of Human History,
is by definition your greatest and most difficult achievement.
Legacies are as unique as personalities,
so as long as it is meaningful no one is greater than the next.
There is an exception worth noting here,
the legacies of those who have convinced themselves they are not worth the while.
It is always the most delicate ones that lead the way,
step by step, torch in hand.
If you are certain that you haven&apos;t got a story to tell,
then that means you are being called, to tell it.
Greatness is certainly not a requirement for a Meaningful Legacy,
in absence of greatness it will be your legacy, that will make you a Great Being.
Write, write, and protect your journals,
do not make the same mistakes that those who have been permanently lost to history, made.
Every story, begs to be told, every path must be enlightened,
even the most unique of us will have the little ones surely meander by.
Every spirit committed to every book,
will be resurrected and brought to light by some young adventurer in a search for meaning.
Your legacy,
is the inextinguishable light you bring to the world.
And if you so! dare to say,
&quot;I am not a writer...&quot;
Then allow me to respond,
and with all respect, Dear Reader:
If you feel, that you can&apos;t yet write about your life.
Then that can only mean, that you have not yet lived, and that you are in danger.
The danger of life passing you by, but that also means, that you are being called to gentle adventure.
You are being called to find yourself, you are called to restore ancient paths, and you are called to extend and enlighten new ones.
You are a creature of the Universe, and you are meant to connect with the stars, and the lakes and the seas, and breathe, breathe the mountain air.
Make no mistake, you are a Creature of the Universe, not a child, not a student, not a worker, NOT AN OVER-WORKER, but a fine and rare creation of the Timeless and Infinite Universe.
And there is still a faint chance that we are the only Intelligent Species in the Universe, that we are Universe&apos;s only way to know it self.
So, don&apos;t ever think to your self, that you are not a writer, or that you have nothing to say, or that you will live later.
The writing implement nearest you holds the beginning of the thread that will weave the path that many will follow, and learn from in your eternal recurrence.
If you are not a writer, then go home and pack, and start your journey with a sunrise at Haleakala Crater on the island of Maui in Hawaii.
Our Civilization begs constant enlightenment to ensure its progress and survival.
Without the commitment of Greatness and Legacy our momentum will be lost and we will slowly and imperceptibly regress into Dark Ages whilst pointlessly clutching our intercontinental ballistic missiles as the last tree dies.
The liars in authority silently parade the effects of ineffective education as proof that we have no Good Will and can&apos;t have World Peace and Prosperity.
In their madness they can&apos;t comprehend the power of Knowledge, Wisdom, Greatness, and Legacy; as the process of inheriting from great lives of wisdom could not be more alien to them.
It is up to you and every other Honest Human Being,
to for a time become keepers of the flame of Authenticity and Enlightenment, in that endless chain of generations.
The Human Life has traditionally begun with a symbolic journey of many challenges and much intellectual inheritance,
it is in a certain kind of sacred loneliness that we find our beginning, and in private motion forward that we discover our pace of progress.
The liars want you to think that you are a child, and that they are in charge of you,
it is a fraud as old as the most misled of civilizations.
It is you who is all, pick up your journal and let your legacy be discovered by those who are sure to follow,
you may shrug the fools but in the process you cannot help that those who are yet to come will take to standing on your shoulders and following your thread... Ariadne.
Countless many will follow in your path, across many centuries to come,
and few will never let go of your works no matter how ancient your tongue will become.
They will honor your hard won lessons by inhering them directly from you.
The countless will make your aches and lessons count for more.
The most frequent of those who will take to resurrect your spirit in the millennium ahead,
are surely going to be the most Beautifully Melancholy of Mighty Teenagers,
the most rebellious of the rebels, the most Angel-headed of the Hipsters of their time.
Young Poets as melancholy as you, the day you realize that time has finally come to Through-hike the Appalachian Trail.
There will be Artists searching for the stars in the night, as passionate as the last rays of Haleakala Sun come sunset.
There will be Musicians, howling YOUR LYRICS in the night, in hopes of comprehending what you meant in the most passionate of your scribbles.
No, no, you are not a child, or a student, or a worker, you are not waiting for a promotion, you are not wasting your life,
you are an important chain link that connects the past to the future, and more brilliant and more important then the light of all the stars.
And there will be no progress without your journals and poems,
the others are not enough to pave the wisdom forward, it is either all of us, or none.
Therefore, may the beauty of your knowledge create the path that your cheerful wisdom will in turn permanently enlighten,
may you embrace your personal quest for greatness and leave a legacy to kindle many a flame in the countless many to discover it anew.

it is for you so that you may live a beautiful and meaningful life.
It cannot be sold or rented,
because it is priceless.
Nor, can you give it away,
under any circumstance.
Everybody that has something to gain,
will try to push you to work past your limit.
You can&apos;t allow that,
your life is not meant to be spent on work.
You should only work enough,
so that you are safe.
It is hard to keep a balanced existence,
but we must always search and never give in.
We are not machines, nor cogs in one,
we are Music, Poetry, Great Thinker and Dreamers.
We have to protect what makes us beautiful,
overwork can only prevent us from fixing the world.
We are each meant to become well-read,
knowledgeable, wise and an outspoken inspiration to many.
The younger generations are always in need of Great Teachers,
as they all to easily accept the status quo.
All the world nations require great improvement,
and to change the world, we can only rely on Wisdom.</span>
