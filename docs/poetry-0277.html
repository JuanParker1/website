                    <p>The best kind of trouble is the trouble you create for yourself,</p>
                    <p>there is no limit to how elaborate of a problem you can invent.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Relativity and contrast play a very important role here,</p>
                    <p>the lower you are and the higher you aim the more it is worth the trouble.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is safe to say that a nice and comfortable bed with an electric blanket,</p>
                    <p>on a quiet and sleepy afternoon is a pretty good low.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A pretty good height to reach is either ten miles by foot,</p>
                    <p>or 1,500 miles by car where it usually involves a beach somewhere.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Moreover, you need a team deadline, a snooze button, a soon to end semester,</p>
                    <p>and an ungrateful team where you do all the work, add a few bullies...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>and your co-worker whispering:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did she get a raise, she doesn&apos;t know anything&quot; - emphasizing &quot;she doesn&apos;t know&quot;.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>While not purrfect, this is a really good start,</p>
                    <p>and erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,</p>
                    <p>and a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>See, you are not just headed for Key West and back,</p>
                    <p>I m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,</p>
                    <p>it is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,</p>
                    <p>they are usually there because something beautiful is going on.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>You never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,</p>
                    <p>it could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Personally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,</p>
                    <p>but it is fine for a woman.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And you certainly don&apos;t want to realize come your late golden age,</p>
                    <p>that you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Now, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,</p>
                    <p>to wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>An hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,</p>
                    <p>it won&apos;t be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,</p>
                    <p>how nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,</p>
                    <p>there is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,</p>
                    <p>and do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger&apos;s road - that ain&apos;t good.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Eventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,</p>
                    <p>and stop at the next park.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,</p>
                    <p>you can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Now, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,</p>
                    <p>be good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won&apos;t last long at all.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Don&apos;t make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,</p>
                    <p>and figured why don&apos;t I use a pencil at first...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>...smart right?</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,</p>
                    <p>treat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If you want to speak at length,</p>
                    <p>do what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Healing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound &quot;dumb&quot; to you after a bit,</p>
                    <p>but that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A lot of people will stay in bed,</p>
                    <p>they will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,</p>
                    <p>she could then come around and tell them &quot;Hey! you will never get a raise again?&quot;, that could still snap them out of it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But, if the boss is not fully crazed,</p>
                    <p>you are their last hope.</p>

                    <p>The trouble you go through to learn to jog,</p>
                    <p>or try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>As all end of the road towns are tourist traps,</p>
                    <p>so, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Except maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,</p>
                    <p>very few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Yeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,</p>
                    <p>to all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.</p>

                    <p>No human should lead the life of a house cat,</p>
                    <p>we are very dynamic, and doing beautiful unusual things helps us stay healthy.</p>

                    <p>One, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,</p>
                    <p>it was clearly the husband&apos;s idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,</p>
                    <p>and not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,</p>
                    <p>now the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>I am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,</p>
                    <p>and thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Between the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.</p>
                    <p>That this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They stayed the weekend,</p>
                    <p>but they needed at least three weeks if not months.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They needed to stop racing forward,</p>
                    <p>they needed more adventures, more &quot;inconvenience&quot;, more trouble-making as I call it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>That woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,</p>
                    <p>she had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>See emanated the mana that bespoke that,</p>
                    <p>the standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Anyway, still a glorious couple,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Culture switching is the best way to learn, it is about discovering that not only one&apos;s own culture is fluid,
but also, that there is no standard culture, just a colorful bouquet.
I think most people assume that switching cultures
means living in some other country for a but moving around is just as good.
The point is not to be glued to a single spot,
but continue adapting to as many as possible.
Moreover, changing the way we live is just as good,
spending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail is the most powerful example.
Above all, going to sleep when it gets dark, and rising to watch the sun rise,
is a great treasure, that brings great heath and strength.
Going forward every day, and slowing down to match the pace of nature,
helps people have long thoughts and connects all their dots together.
Discomfort, is not part of learning and growing, or healing,
it is just that we must not succumb to fear and imaginary dragons.
Doing new things is not perfect, but it is not discomfort,
discomfort is when someone is hurting you, or life is crushing you.
These are the situations that require drastic changes,
not just a set of changes, but a long term series of changes.
Some people, presumably at-least armchair psychologists,
say that we end up using a more logical side of our brain...
But, I am sure that our brains are infinitely more complex than that,
and what is actually going on is that we are leaving a kind of depression behind.
One of our main missions in life, is to live it to its fullest because, life is precious,
and that includes living in balance with nature, wisdom, and universe.
And while, I do admit that this sounds a wee bit hokey,
the best way to personally explore ideas behind heath and balance.
Is to try to imagine our elder selves,
at say, 85 and a half years, young.
It is hard to deny that, no one is more connected to the elder you, than you right now,
you can try to project your predispositions and try to imagine what the elder you is like.
Our energy is found in balanced living,
we have to move away from stress, and depression, and overwork.
Our intelligence, and creativity, our memory, and ability to learn, and read books,
requires that we take really good care of ourselves.
In school and at work, you will find your self facing,
what I would call Profit Optimization.
Mediocre teachers will want a perfect mediocre score,
that is slightly above their last year statistics so that they may show improvement.
The average employer will want you to do more for less,
or to get more out of you, without investing more into you.
And that means,
pushing you past your healthy balance.
Encouraging use of medications that help with temporary memory at school,
and whatever pushes you into overwork and over performing at work.
If you don&apos;t do that,
you will be replaced by someone who is willing to live sick for the minimum you got paid, or less.
Allow me to digress, and say that to deal with both of these issues in a healthy fashion,
you can self-educate and and aim to build a serious of start-ups.
Now, when building your companies, you will be tasked with not pushing yourself,
while it is easier to overwork in short term, it is not worth it in long term.
You need heart, and soul, and long visions and thoughts to craft your own future,
and being stressed, depressed, and overworked will only take those powers away from you.
Living healthy should be the easiest thing for you, cramming, overworking, stressing, depressing,
and squeezing every last bit of energy out of yourself, aught to be the more difficult path.
Just listen to what I am saying;
when you are healthy and in balance with your self, or with nature, whatever you conceive to be:
You are at your most intelligent, and most creative, and strongest self,
you are also most beautiful, and I am sure at your funniest, in that worst of ways where no one is sure if are joking or dead serious.
One of the ways to connect with your elder self,
is to make them better, is to grant them outrageous gifts from your youth.
Even if just to remind them,
who the boss really is, or to make them smile in wonder.
Great beings often appear slightly odd and confusingly funny, just because of that,
they are sending a message into their own future, to guarantee the health of their elder selves.
Culture switching helps a person become unstuck,
it exposes them to new experiences, and removes old discomforts, and often making them more courageous.
It is important to read books, and that means to live in a state that is conducive to inheriting lifetimes of knowledge,
and that state just can&apos;t be found at places that aim to push you out of balance for their own profit.
It sounds terrible, but this is just a call to rising, to self balancing, to becoming an independent thinker,
to leaving all influences whether perceptible of obscured, behind you, in a blur of a series of challenges.
With each new step,
you will learn new things.
With each new culture,
you will become more illuminated.
And with each Great Endeavor,
you will become, greater.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Rise, to get an eagle eye view,
because the world belongs to you.
Too many problems come from fantasies,
there are too many of them to mention.
So many of them are so miserable,
that no poem can hold them.
We can only really rise,
high and above anything and everything.
We can only really make real decisions,
once we have a good view of the world.
Until we are certain that we aren&apos;t under some influence,
we can&apos;t be certain that our decisions are entirely our own.
Great battles come to all of us,
be it stress, cancer, cult, poverty, or country.
We need to be certain that we are fighting the right thing,
it is crazy for a poor person to steal a car to get out of poverty.
It is a whole new level of evil to keep a person so poor,
that they fight the wrong thing, and then send them to prison and slavery.
Nothing, other than reaching out for other lifetimes,
can help us rise tho this height.
And the way we transfer knowledge between lifetimes,
is books, memoirs, biographies, stories of adventure, and triumph, and failure.
All the bad ideas have already been lived, and described, and compressed to wisdom,
don&apos;t let the world stress you out, grab an audio book and figure it all out.
When you are ready,
perhaps come your golden age.
Allow your autobiographical impulse,
to take possession of you, and write down what you have learned.
Share with the little ones,
so that they need not start where you started, but at the height you rose to.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Break out of broken education, religions, governments, and status quo,
do not fear those who secretly fear you, you are a Citizen of the World first.
And be careful, don&apos;t let liars make a fool out of you,
poverty is everywhere, and it fractures those who can&apos;t handle it.
Poverty, frequently causes a poverty of mind,
then all the creativity that makes a person amazing, turns dark.
You have to look around, understand the nature of things,
that&apos;s exactly what books can give you, and school can never teach you.
Self awareness is about gaining some grasp on the layers of influence you are under,
this is so incredibly error prone that people rarely get it right at first.
In their haste for truth they invent things that are not real,
our inability to see what is holding us down is a nightmare.
But not breaking out, is worse than a nightmare, it is a life sentence,
victims of cults, bad parenting, strange or frightening beliefs, eventually unravel.
The road to self awareness, is a road to understanding what is real and
what has been pulled over our eyes to have us serve some purpose.
Sometimes servitude has been so optimized that no one being can spot it,
it takes thousands of people and their donations to catch on the fraud.
Therefore, all people must do their travel upwards, out and over, any and all influence,
and books are critical to helping us up, and towards knowledge and wisdom.
Freedom is the first and foremost human right, freedom to go anywhere,
freedom to think anything, freedom to dream and share, freedom of speech and inspiration.
Now, look at school, look how easily you accepted your grades,
how easily you got misled into memorization and got cheated out of learning.
You never noticed school was bad,
even though it was unfair and often made no sense.
All this evidence, right in front of your eyes,
but you kept believing.
My Friends,
you are the New Generations, you are the change you hope to see.
You must practice self awareness,
and learn to see through, what you have accepted for granted, and the cultures you were born into.
Our task is to Unite Humanity so that there is no more War, no more Poverty, no more Lies,
so that all Darkness is brought into light of Wisdom, and for all to see.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Education in the context of an individual is the path to wisdom and greatness,
in the context of the whole world, however, education is a path to World Peace.
Education is a very unusual thing,
it enhances everything it can touch.
To borrow from movies,
education is our loading program.
To borrow from computers,
education is our operating system.
Without education, we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,
we end up living in villages and inventing gods to help with harvest and afterlife.
Organized and mandatory education is a recent invention,
it works up to middle school where teachers begin hiding inexperience behind abstractions.
When teaching a class of multiple students there is only time for lowest common denominators,
everything gets hurried along and those who can&apos;t understand something begin memorizing.
Within a few years everyone is temporarily memorizing everything to be sure they graduate,
those who try to learn, are graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.
Nobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,
and teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.
That is not education,
that is memorization, acting.
Our loading program does not load,
our operating system does not initialize.
System crashes,
and fathers eagerly send their boys to kill boys of other fathers.
Politics becomes infested with pretenders, actors, con-men, and simple liars,
voters simply don&apos;t think about electing people who show wisdom, who share books.
Lack of modern knowledge and the stress it begets will slow people down,
it will be difficult to become wise, it may not be possible to become great.
Failure to propagate modern knowledge, seems to take the shape of,
an uneducated majority, and a tiny educated minority without any voting power.
Once the failure of education takes hold,
nothing can be done to fix the anomalies that occur afterwards.
The only way to help things along is to avoid the emergence of anomalies in the first place,
and that means having a functional educational system.
If it is not possible for a nation to teach its children,
if the dream of organized, mandatory and standardized education is not realistic.
Personalized computer based, self education must be put in its place,
the transition can be made easy by transitioning from grades to money, credits, or bonds.
The initial computer based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,
a little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.
I write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,
but what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.
We are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other&apos;s beliefs based on color of skin,
they come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.
We have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,
of someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.
We have two nations that feature concentration camps,
and the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.
All of this is happening because of failure of schooling,
inability of politicians to build.
Now, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,
which deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.
We can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation&apos;s future,
and that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.
Let us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,
countries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.
Students in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,
and the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.
After all what is more prestigious than the child&apos;s real knowledge,
a child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.
Making some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,
and it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.
Graduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can&apos;t be erased with bankruptcy,
but with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.
The cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,
this is what it means to have a country.
What we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,
and research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.
We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,
where it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.
We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,
that sometimes make children die of starvation.
Humanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,
it has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.
For those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,
take a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.
Initially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,
would set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.
Call it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,
in process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.
Out of Love and Wisdom,
out of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.
And my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,
what would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">The best way to win against a liar, is to never meet one,
the simplest way to &quot;win&quot; is not to play their game.
This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,
liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.
One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,
they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn&apos;t cause much headache.
But it, looking like an expensive medicine, and costing like one,
when people felt it in their system, they automatically assumed it was working.
This is still going on, and when I was a teenager I actually bought a skin cleanser,
at a pharmacy, in the US, that in no uncertain terms, stated that this was homeopathic medicine,
Home and medicine, sounded good to me,
and it seemed to have been a gentle soap, but it was just the cheapest thing that they could possibly put in a tube.
I checked the top three pharmacies in the US in 2020, and heart-breakingly,
they all continue selling homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
Knowledge and Wisdom, and the path it entails,
is the most wonderful and safest way to avoid all this nonsense.
Because once you become more knowledgeable than the liar,
you will be able to hear them bending words, and twisting stories, the way your Mum was able to pick up on subtle cues when you were lying as a baby.
Now, past some point in an education, many, or perhaps most people, front healthy skepticism first,
not because they assume everyone is a liar, but because they wonder if someone might not have tricked themselves into a falsehood like I did with my homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
More than that, when I was a teenager, and someone asked me if Mokele-mbembe existed,
I would whole heatedly, and with all the love in my heart, say:
&quot;I hope so, after all, it is not a question of their existence, is it now? They used to exist millions of years ago.
It is a question of whether or not there is one or two, left in Rhodesia.&quot; - with a heavy and hairy accent, whilst bouncing my unibrow up an down.
Anybody asking me about cryptozoology was better off,
fronting mountains of skepticism first - the brontosaurus was my favorite dinosaur!
And get this, Brontosaurus is no longer the same thunder lizard we are all familiar with,
it was a misclassification, the dinosaur that you think of as Brontosaurus is actually called Apatosaurus now.
In context of liars, which are pretty damn scary, and only get more frightening as they come together in groups,
...searching for forgiveness, reinforcement and easy pickings to whatever their disorder is; we need to take to knowledge and wisdom as soon as possible.
Middle school, is a pretty good time to start learning for real,
and start climbing over everyone&apos;s heads, to get ahead of things.
Books narrated by their authors,
are an especially precious gift of knowledge.
Bill Bryson has some nice and funny books that help people grow,
A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, and In a Sunburned Country, are beautiful.
But it is best that you start with what moves you,
look at various best seller lists, and keep an eye on non-fiction of you can.
And climb, keep searching for that next book that will agree with you,
and explore everything, explore the world, the trails, the libraries, all the places of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.
It does not take many books to get ahead of liars,
it only takes a few more to get ahead of those that don&apos;t know they are causing harm.
And here the handful of your beloved Memoirs, Biographies, and adventure books,
will transform, to your Sword and Shield, and you will fell many a monster and dragon, onward to a cheerful future.
Start learning on your own, not just to avoid liars and crappy people,
but to become you, the person that you are predisposed to be.
As you grow, there will be some mild regrets, but it is not going to be anything huge,
and whatever you do end up missing by taking your own less traveled road...
Use is as a compass, just because you missed something, it doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t find it again,
feeling like you missed something is a beautiful call to new adventure.
There is nothing to be scared of, by choosing the path of Knowledge, Wisdom, and maybe Greatness,
those are the very components by which humanity grows.
Our superpowers that grant us the abilities to prevent suffering.
making our pains count for more by fixing the problems that hurt us, and preventing others from falling into the same trap.
