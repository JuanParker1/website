          <p>My Friends, it is very important not to think in terms of Others running the world,<br>
            whoever holds the power now, will be too old in a handful or years.</p>
          <p>The world is yours, but it is nowhere near ready,<br>
            it needs great ideas, a lot of work, and it comes with many challenges.</p>
          <p>The world you have been born into is not a static masterpiece,<br>
            but rather, it is constantly hoping for you to help it grow.</p>
          <p>You are the Hope and the Dream of past generations,<br>
            it is your responsibility to grow all the way up and continue and improve the work of Great Beings.</p><br>
          <p>We Grow,<br>
            by reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
          <p>This also means that when we are young, we are yet to gain the necessary Knowledge and Wisdom,<br>
            The content of character required for the correct decision making that will do justice to our elder selves.</p>
          <p>This means we need to take time to prepare ourselves for Life,<br>
            we have to make careful observations, and carefully capture all the worthy wisdom.</p>
          <p>We have to recognize that when lacking life experience,<br>
            we are other than we should be.</p>
          <p>There is a solution practiced by all the world&apos;s greatest minds,<br>
            it is the unrelenting pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.</p>
          <p>For thousands of years it has been proven method,<br>
            to help us become who we need to be to do our elder selves justice.</p>
          <p>We have no choice but to expand our minds with Knowledge,<br>
            and enlarge our worlds with Love of Wisdom.</p><br>
          <p>The World Grows,<br>
            by means of informed decision-making.</p>
          <p>Mislead or Uninformed decision-making is a Human Problem,<br>
            and all Human Problems, have Human Solutions.</p>
          <p>We have connected all the nations with internet,<br>
            we have created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.</p>
          <p>We have witnessed the creation of European Union,<br>
            countries that speak different languages.</p>
          <p>All the world accepted standardized schooling,<br>
            as a standard that we all follow.</p>
          <p>We have come a long way,<br>
            towards Wisdom and Peace.</p><br>
          <p>Time has come to make better use of these amazing advancements,<br>
            and to hasten our pace of development as One Human Family.</p>
          <p>We face common problems that require an Informed and United World,<br>
            we have made many mistakes in the past 100 years, and we have learned much.</p>
          <p>We can no longer see ourselves as invisible parts of our little neighborhoods,<br>
            we must now rise to the challenges of becoming a Citizen of The World.</p><br>
          <p>We must grow beyond the need for our own Knowledge and Wisdom,<br>
            onward to making Meaningful and Lasting Contributions towards helping the world become more mature.</p>
          <p>We can no longer serve, as we are not heartless and soulless cogs in a blind machine,<br>
            we must now rise to question, judge, evaluate, challenge and fearlessly stand for wisdom.</p><br>
          <p>In all of Human History we never lost sight of Family, Peace, Wisdom, and Love,<br>
            not for a day, not for a moment.</p>
          <p>Every day of human history pushed to become better than the previous,<br>
            and any fractures that occurred have had the global community come together in hopes of repairs.</p>
          <p>Let us hasten our pace with an aim that none suffer for any reason,<br>
            be it hate, punishment, arrogance or ignorance.</p>
          <p>Where we cannot fix something, let us use the power of time,<br>
            and either prevent new fractures before they begin,<br>
            of establish benefits for those born after a certain year in the future.</p>
          <p>Let us never leave a chain-link unlined,<br>
            there is not to be a courtroom without a meaningful force of prevention and rehabilitation on each side.</p>
          <p>There is not to be a war,<br>
            where it could have been prevented with education, knowledge and wisdom.</p><br>
          <p>Let us make sure that all generations from now on, know with certainty and understanding,<br>
            that their first step in life - and the true rite of passage - is the acquisition of wisdom,<br>
            and capacity of decision-making worthy of their elder selves.</p>
          <p>Above all, we must remind the children with Knowledge and Science,<br>
            that they are a Child of The Universe first.</p>
          <p>And with History,<br>
            that to them belongs the future.</p>
          <p>That they are to reject the status quo,<br>
            because what was well enough for the previous generation,<br>
            now needs improvement to do the current one justice.</p>
