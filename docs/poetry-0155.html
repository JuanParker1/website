        <p>I was tossing and turning late at night,<br>
          only to be awoken by thunder and a flash of light.</p>
        <p>The room shook and I felt it in my chest,<br>
          but I was wearing earplugs so I didn&apos;t hear the rest.</p>
        <p>I used to be scared of thunder quite a bit,<br>
          then I was told if you can hear it - you didn&apos;t get hit.</p>
        <p>I am not sure what kind of advice that is,<br>
          but it made thunderstorms a breeze.</p>
        <p>I figured it was going to be too wet and muddy,<br>
          to ride my iron horse buddy.</p>
        <p>So I resumed working on my web page,<br>
          and now I am in the finishing stage.</p>
        <p>When all else fails there is always web design,<br>
          at the end of the day everything will turn out fine.</p>
        <p>I had to rest a bit as I switched from 8PM to 5AM for my endurance running,<br>
          but now I feel can resume, and become even more stunning.</p>
