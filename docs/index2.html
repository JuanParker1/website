                      there is a moment when you go from observer to creator.

                      It is similar to how you arrive in a new city,
                      at first you are unsure, but eventually it becomes your home town.

                      In politics, politicians so through something similar,
                      but it is a mistake, they become comfortable around manipulators,
                      and get comfortable with manipulating, propagating the blight.

                      In the world of books, the authors that resonate with you,
                      become your friends, Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Dan Brown,
                      they become family and you get to know them in your own way.

                      In world adventures, it is called going native, or emanating mana,
                      one moment you are an outsider, and the next you are riding a bull to work,
                      where you spend your days working hard on digging new wells,
                      hurrying to finish before your visa expires and you have get back to the loud and filthy city.

                      When knowledge becomes internalized, it becomes wisdom,
                      you become able to synthesize more knowledge out of what you already know,
                      some call it Enlightenment.

                      It all cases, it is natural, human, simple and easy to get to,
                      it is not rare, it is not a power granted only to special people,
                      it is a power that makes people more special.

                      If you read enough audio books that move you in the same direction,
                      you&apos;ll go from listening about something to becoming a participant in thinking about it.

                      It is a feeling so powerful at first,
                      that some become convinced they are geniuses,
                      and have deeper knowledge

                      &quot;Nope! that&apos;s just your first tipping point dude,
                      keep going though, because you are just about as amazing as you think you are, don&apos;t stop learning&quot;.

                      The more tipping points, and plateaus,
                      upon which we rests as we move towards the sunny parts of our mountain range.

                      The more capable we become, the more we can synthesize,
                      and the more of the things we synthesize slowly do become unique and amazing.

                      Finally, the more we know,
                      the easier it is to understand other people&apos;s works,
                      we begin sharing more and more with other creators.

                      That&apos;s Real Education,
                      we become specialists in our own unique corners of the world,

                      Eventually we too get stung by the urge to share what we know,
                      both the unique little discoveries or contributions we made,
                      and in memoirs that describe all the twisty little passages that got us there.</a></p>

                      Hypatia, Socrates, Giordano Bruno; that is always the Noblest start,
                      you start in the beginning.

                      Then,
                      Books, Audio Books, School Library, Public Library, Every Library.

                      You learn and rise, to improve on their works.
                      then Ayn Rand, Avital Ronell, Martha Nussbaum, everyone, Every Great Mind.

                      But also your mind,
                      knowing that it is your Sacred Right to protect its integrity,
                      completeness,
                      beauty.

                      Those who are attacking you, belittling you, threatening you, expecting you to serve,
                      those who make you feel fear, dread, pain,
                      will destroy you - if you let them.

                      Resist, peacefully, like the greatest of warriors,
                      see their rage and anger as a flaw in them,
                      and your inner-peace as a superpower in you.

                      Know, with all certainty,
                      that you are The Hope,
                      and The Dream of the Greatest Minds, awakened thus far.

                      It was you that Hypatia, Socrates, Giordano Bruno sent the last of their Hopes and Everlasting Love to.

                      The Little, You.

                      The Thinker, The Dreamer, The Wanderer, The Watcher and Observer.

                      They cared not for Prime Ministers, and Presidents, or Royalty.

                      Only For The Other Saints.

                      Only for the Little Ones.

                      You.

                      You are not to be a victim of indoctrination into cultures of Fat White Lice.

                      Let the lice, age,
                      let that be the main strategy.

                      In the World of Clarity,
                      the one Constructed by Hope and Dream,
                      of the Greatest of Warriors who have made great strides through he greatest of trials.

                      We begin by learning to Prevent Problems,
                      prevent them before they begin and grow unfixable.

                      We begin in a world that sees it self across time,
                      and recognizes that a prolonged failure in leadership will become a cause for Dark Ages.

                      Dark ages, where multiple generations will have to wait for the politicians to step down of old age,
                      so that we may take their place and work for All Humanity,
                      including those who are yet to come.

                      No one generation is to force another into inheritance of problems like Mass Incarceration,
                      Fake Schools and Education, few Worthy Professors in deed.

                      We are not passing on burdens onto You,
                      we inherited them too,
                      they just can&apos;t be fixed today.

                      We are teaching You to rise and learn to prevent things - rather than attempt to fix them directly,
                      we are asking You to teach your Little Ones to carry on this Great Tradition of Infinite Foresight.

                      The aim is World Peace,
                      and Multicultural Convergence on Wisdom.

                      All Human Beings,
                      rising to the challenge of becoming; Great Beings,
                      by inheriting wisdom from Audio Books, Internet Lectures and Videos, Books and Libraries, Museums, and Galleries,
                      Great Minds form all across History.

                      The world you see around you now,
                      with pointless Wars and Murders,
                      Prisons, Secret Prisons, Concentration Camps,
                      Torture and Enhanced Interrogation,
                      Helpless or Lying Politicians,
                      the plague of &quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;,
                      Famine, Poverty, Broken Welfare, Heartbreaking Minimum wage,
                      Ten Million Of Us Behind Bars.

                      Is what a world becomes when people... Forget.

                      When they forget,
                      that we can&apos;t grow without Knowledge and Wisdom,
                      and that our proper upright posture is that of a Great Being.

                      We just need to remember,
                      and we will rise,
                      and continue on this time.

                      One Family,
                      Across All Time,
                      All Generations,
                      One Wisdom.

                      of what one thinks today,
                      and another tomorrow morning.

                      But, the world belongs,
                      to all the future generations,
                      we are just temporary residents.

                      We are not to treat Earth,
                      as if it only belonged to us.

                      We are to stop lying to children,
                      that memorization is education.

                      We are to stop keeping in them in rows,
                      dividing time into squares,
                      and subjects into meaninglessness,
                      in a one-for-all curriculum of poverty of mind.

                      Respect, is a reward, so don&apos;t demand it,
                      it is not a demand anybody can make.

                      And we are to stop thinking in short term,
                      rather than keeping ten million people in cages,
                      we need to practice Crime Prevention and put an End to Poverty first.

                      Rather than economic fairy-tales,
                      mutually assured destruction, and blind wars,
                      we need to connect together across borders and in wisdom.

                      There is very little prestige to be gained,
                      from hard work and beautiful career, tailored suits,
                      and expensive cafes if we are not paying attention to all the problems children face.

                      That&apos;s just reality, the respect of the younger generations cannot be granted for free,
                      children can&apos;t believe nonsense no matter how convincing the teachers,
                      and the world won&apos;t grow without Wisdom.

                      The world will wait,
                      for several consecutive generations of Wise Beings,
                      to converge on good ideas, in Peace and Earned Respect.

                      It will wait.

                      It need not be hard work, you know,
                      reading books or listening to audio books comes so easy,
                      and there is so much we learn - we inherit lifetimes of knowledge.

                      Though it is Beautiful, and Healing, and Wonderful,
                      Wisdom is not just for us, it is for all the future.

                      Many of the problems that overwhelm us,
                      really can&apos;t be repaired, the career politicians are lying.

                      The big problems,
                      can only be prevented with Foresight, and Love, and Wisdom,
                      and require hard work by multiple generations

                      And that can only begin with Real Education,
                      and Real Love of Wisdom.

                      Please rise to the challenge,
                      and become a great being.</a></p>

                      but as we grow, it requires upgrades, education, insights.

                      Philosophy, Love of Wisdom,
                      the uncontradictory arrangement of thoughts which that represents,
                      must constantly aim to correct, expand and refine it self.

                      Even while in pursuit of knowledge and finest thoughts,
                      we will unfortunately inherit some mistaken observations.

                      Philosophers often do their best work right on the edge of their very limits,
                      they can&apos;t haul all their tools out there, they do their best, when they do their most.

                      We have to check their work, and should they mistaken,
                      we have to come to their aid, and make repairs to their works.

                      This is why me must constantly monitor what we are learning,
                      even if the ideas come from people we are admire.

                      In a word,
                      we too have to become Philosophers.

                      Philosophers and Great Beings aim to bring light to the world,
                      light of Knowing and Knowledge, light for The Human Condition.

                      They welcome repairs to their works,
                      they hope, you will come to think with them.

                      And they hope that You too,
                      will become a Philosopher.

                      Wisdoms alter our decision making, sometimes reverse our opinions,
                      we must learn, we must inherit all of the greatest wisdoms.

                      Without that education and inheritance,
                      we can&apos;t be sure if the choices we are meaning are correct.

                      In some cases - allegory of the cave, altered education, or just cheap propaganda,
                      we can&apos;t even be sure if the opinions we hold dear are our own,
                      or if they are simply effects of the facts that we have been allowed to learn and grow with.

                      Pursuit of Wisdom, in all its color, not only makes us wise,
                      but it helps us become leaders, and pushes us away from the life of following.

                      While becoming a Philosopher or a Great Being may seem optional today,
                      ask your Elder Self,
                      if being able to inspire the younger generation to Genius is something that you may wish for.</a></p>

                      its greatest weapon would be the control of the level of knowledge,
                      and control of what is allowed to be known.

                      Even without an enemy, we fall into the trap of unknowing, all on our own,
                      ..and we make, what we discover later on to be, wrong decisions.

                      While we are making those decisions,
                      we are certainly making them with goodness in mind,
                      but without knowledge, good intentions may indeed, pave a way to hell.

                      This is something that has been known for thousands of years,
                      control of what is known is the evil behind slavery,
                      it is the evil behind manufactured consent.

                      And anything, that stands in the way of real education,
                      even broken schools, should be seen as an attack,
                      the theft of our intellectual inheritance.

                      Real Education must be seen as one of our Greatest Rights,
                      as a Great Treasure, a Great Honor, and Great Reward.

                      Failure to see that, is a sign that something has gone wrong,
                      and it is time to begin reading books on your own.

                      Be mindful of schools that are not educating you,
                      find your way to the library, read all the books that help you,
                      drop out, and carry on in Relentless Pursuit of Knowledge.

                      Know with full certainty,
                      that Dysfunctional Education, Neutered Education,
                      Education that fails to help you become Wise,
                      and Education that Makes You Feel Trapped, of Stupid,
                      is Fake Education!

                      It is a trick
                      that is robbing you of your right to knowledge and your path to greatness;

                      Find A library, find the Philosophy Section,
                      and find your beloved books there.

                      In the absence of teachers, you become a teacher,
                      learn, so that you may help others grow.

                      Humanity needs you to become a Great Being,
                      so that it too, can grow.</a></p>

                      there is but one answer, and it is never to be uttered quietly.

                      You must feel it and yell it,
                      yell it because every moment is a precious miracle.

                      So you yell: Higher!
                      Because higher is the answer, and it the only answer there ever was.

                      Higher, because we never know how far we need to go and grow,
                      so it is just is better, to keep going and never stop, ever, no matter how much you know.

                      Don&#x2019;t stop for bullies,
                      don&#x2019;t stop for teachers,
                      don&#x2019;t stop for the office,
                      don&#x2019;t stop for a career,
                      just fly right by.

                      Because, the first and foremost is to break out of all limits,
                      breach, each and every boundary, and rise right on top, over and over, and tip each tipping point.

                      Every book that makes Wise Beings smile,
                      read it, read it many times, record the good parts and play them back to sleep.

                      And then after your first ten or twenty books, or hundred books,
                      you write your own, and make it known.

                      And keep moving,
                      and don&#x2019;t stop,
                      because every wall must fall.

                      That A in class, that GPA in college, that Promotion and Office Window,
                      all of that has to go.

                      It is amazing to return to, from the great heights of your mountains,
                      but for now you go, because you are not a brick in that wall.

                      Find your limits,
                      and build your way out.

                      Our flaw is such, that we don&#x2019;t notice bad ideas that we are born around,
                      and if we keep growing into that life we will run aground.

                      All you need to do, is become a Great Being first,
                      then you can come back, and if you want it all, then you can have it all back.

                      ...but first you grow, because without growing first, you&#x2019;ll never know which way to go.</a></p>

                      so went about it in a warrior&apos;s way.

                      I looked out the window and it was entirely too dark,
                      I said, &quot;I hope I wont have to hide under a tree in some park.&quot;

                      As I made it to Ford Road it didn&apos;t seem that bad,
                      and then I felt the first three drops hit my head.

                      I decided to keep going as a proper health nut should,
                      and a quarter way through, I got soaked pretty good.

                      Just when I thought the clouds parted,
                      there was a grumble and the rain really started.

                      It rained heavy, but it didn&apos;t last very long,
                      I ran cheerfully feeling Mighty and Strong.

                      My biggest problem were the geese,
                      where I come from it is a fierce creature that knows no peace.

                      When I was a child they chased me and would often hiss,
                      but the ones by the Mall seem to be loving and full of bliss.

                      I was a beautiful day, without a doubt,
                      and, as the afternoon unfolded the sun came out.</a></p>

                      it will light up the City Streets and help our vision.

                      It will bring us words when we are tired,
                      it will bring us strength when we can&#x2019;t go no more.

                      It is good for a million things,
                      and it does make us Unbreakable.

                      There are so many ways to inherit wisdom.
                      But, the best we can do, in chaos, and noise, and haste, and poverty, is books.

                      The stories of Wisdom in Lectures and Audio Books,
                      and the Super Humanity they bring to us.

                      To the Cries of the Philosophers,
                      the schools have become heartless machines.

                      Processing plants, pushing humans along,
                      to more poverty, more stress, more sacrifice, more achy bones.

                      Just, say, no, because you are not that simple, and your life is too precious,
                      just say no to the ordinary, to the plain, to the push along, play along, force fed mornings.

                      Go to the library, find a way to find all the Audio Books that will move you,
                      go to the beach and just listen how each and every great being rejected that ordinary life.

                      Oh, it cost them all the worthless grades, and all the office space and windows one could ever wish for,
                      but it granted them Freedom, Greatness of Mind, Vastness of Oceans, and Content of Character.

                      Please, break away from the ordinary life,
                      it is just a play along, live along fantasy meant to lull you to sleep.

                      You are meant to be a Force of Nature,
                      a Wave of Change, of Aspiration and Inspiration.

                      Do not go quietly into old age, do not let years and decades pass you by, they only move one way,
                      take to books and adventures, sleep by lakes, travel by boat, by bicycle, swim and distance run.

                      Do not let a moment go by, tick by irreplaceable tock, sleep in the storm and awake to thunder,
                      may each and every irreplaceable moment of your life become a shiny little precious gemstone.

                      You must become a great being,
                      do not let the ordinary life trick you, Greatness it is your Right!</a></p>

                      Learning helps us rise above our limits, and it sets us free from misperceptions.

                      Learning requires that we progress in layers, that we build upon our existing knowledge.
                      We can only grow more knowledgeable when we build a comfortable little road of delicate achievements.

                      Learning requires happy curiosity, enjoyment, satisfaction, and distant horizons.
                      The best kind of education is beautiful, colorful, enriching, and joyful.

                      Calm, joy, happiness and Love of Life, is the is the secret of genius.
                      Happily sitting down beneath an apple tree, to review one&apos;s journals, and every once in a while hear an apple fall.

                      We have to be very careful to avoid toxic environments that push us into hoop jumping, or worse yet cause fractures and breed distrust towards education.
                      In schools of today, we can only really memorize, jump the hoops and follow their rules. That&apos;s not Education, that&apos;s more like role play.

                      Education is too important to play games with.
                      Spending years pretending to get educated, is only going to earn your teacher money and grant you debt.

                      You will get older and poorer, and make your make-believe-teachers look more legitimate.
                      Just say no; choose Authenticity and Self Education, at your own happy pace with the books you love and teachers you admire.

                      Learn on your own, listen to Audio Books and Lectures, choose happiness.
                      Learning is sacred, choose adventure, choose genius.</a></p>

                      it is built layer by layer, step by step, and year by year.

                      We all need might, never has a creature been alive that didn&apos;t need strength,
                      and waiting until the last moment; is a bad idea, anyway.

                      That&apos;s why people run marathons,
                      this is why people challenge themselves with practice.

                      So that when life becomes a challenge,
                      for all the finish lines they crossed, failure won&apos;t cross their mind.

                      A self challenge, is a practice of strength,
                      it is good for us.

                      It is different challenges for different people,
                      at different places in their lives.

                      But there is one thing they all have in common,
                      whatever they set off to do, it seems impossible at first.

                      That&apos;s what the hard parts of life are like,
                      they seem like an impassible challenge at first.

                      Practice makes us strong,
                      difficult challenges help us grow, and help us think too.

                      It is all for life,
                      it is all for enlightenment.

                      It is all for living above the common levels of life,
                      it is all for knowing that no matter the challenge, we will find a way.

                      May we all grow wise, and strong, and healthy,
                      may we each find a mountain to move and inspire a generation.</a></p>

                      where you go from careful observation to certainty of knowing.

                      You build one thing on top of the other,
                      it becomes your Temple of Knowledge.

                      If you are correct about it all,
                      then the more you add the more you understand.

                      To learn for real,
                      we need fascination.

                      And we need freedom to move between curiosities,
                      and there are no divisions of subjects here.

                      We may learn numbers from calculating how many potential exoplanets our radio signals reached,
                      or we may trade mathematical notation for computer programming-languages where we can bring numbers to life.

                      Then quickly leap to Astrophotography, and learn about Biology from books written by Astrobiologists,
                      Enlightenment is not just about what we target precisely, but also what we learn along the way.

                      Enlightenment is Life, it is going round and round, and higher and higher,
                      through all these tiny twisty passages of Curiosity and Fascination to Discover more and more Light.

                      There is no need to divide Enlightenment from Wisdom and Knowledge,
                      but we must make a strong division between Real Education that brings results,
                      and Fake Education that makes you unhappy, exhausted, stressed.

                      Because unhappiness, exhaustion and stress,
                      will stop you from growing up, from becoming wise and enlightened,
                      from becoming an inspiration and helping the world grow a little.

                      It is a scary thing to aim away from everything we&apos;ve been taught to want,
                      but you are you and not what someone tells you to be

                      ...and you are supposed to be much more courageous than merely taking your own path in life,
                      we can&apos;t live like quiet little mice just to be nice.

                      We have too much imagination, too much passion and inspiration, foresight insight and vision,
                      we are not to live ordinary lives.

                      We are Thinking Humans!
                      We are to live Lives of Inspired Enlightenment.

                      Because that&apos;s what furthers Human Kind the most,
                      because that is part of what is best within us.

                      Human Kind must grow in Wisdom and Enlightenment,
                      each of us is more than capable of becoming a Great Being.

                      When we grow the Wold Grows With Us,
                      let us make this world a better place for us all.</a></p>

                      this is occurring because the world places no emphasis on becoming wise.

                      Without wisdom we can&apos;t even tell if education is real or not,
                      ...the mark of a real education are real results.

                      Without wisdom we can&apos;t tell what real results even are,
                      without wisdom we begin repeating old mistakes.

                      People say fake news - nope,
                      but it is actually the fake education...

                      Real education, helps a person become Wise and Noble,
                      Triumphant, Successful, Strong, Unbreakable.

                      In the real world no one ever celebrates graduation,
                      because Real Education is about a Dignified, Realistic Success.

                      If all students get is a Diploma and a Laboratory,
                      or even Debt and a job they didn&apos;t need a University for.

                      It is just a waste of time,
                      and time is priceless.

                      The central component of Real Education is Joy,
                      and satisfaction, and a sense of progression, and the undoing of the threat of poverty.

                      But without wisdom, it is hard to define poverty,
                      or satisfaction, or even what joy is supposed to mean in context of education.

                      Without wisdom, we are easily tricked that memorization has something to do with education,
                      we are easily tricked that confusion is just us not being good enough.

                      Memorization, is a cheap trick used by worthless teachers,
                      to pretend that they are doing something.

                      And by memorizing you make them appear legitimate,
                      you make them produce grades, and appear as teachers.

                      And that confusion is there because their lectures make no sense,
                      the text books probably don&apos;t make much sense either.

                      There is no conspiracy,
                      it is just people trying to fake it until they make it.

                      Many do have lessons they could teach you,
                      and just as many will keep them to themselves.

                      Just to appear smarter someday, or just out of spite,
                      &quot;Why should I tell them, it is not in the text book&quot;.

                      Lack of wisdom will keep a teacher, childlike,
                      keep them thinking &quot;this is just a job&quot;, &quot;it is us versus them&quot;,
                      and that usual &quot;I hate them&quot;, or &quot;hate my job&quot;.

                      There are good teachers out there,
                      but for all their goodness,
                      they know deep down in their hearts.

                      That it is easier for you to learn on your own adventures,
                      Then for them to try to help you understand what they know.

                      Learning is very intimate, and teaching what one knows is taking that intimacy,
                      and trying to reshape it for strangers.

                      Almost by definition this takes away all the passion,
                      all the value of the lessons.

                      Good Teacher,
                      may just be an Oxymoron.

                      It is your life, it must be your own path of discovery and self betterment,
                      no one can help you through this.

                      Learning languages, is something we do naturally,
                      not by memorizing but by becoming submerged in the language; by actually needing it for survival.

                      If you want to learn French,
                      head for the Colonies, inhale the language, don&apos;t memorize it.

                      Learning mathematics, is similar, you don&apos;t do it by memorization,
                      in Real Mathematics same symbols mean different things based on context and author.

                      To learn Math, you start in the beginning,
                      and slowly trace its development across Empires and centuries.

                      Whatever it is You Have To Love It,
                      can you imagine loving every mathematician?

                      Because that&apos;s what it takes to learn Math for real,
                      or Physics, or Chemistry, or Biology, or Astrophysics.

                      Now imagine trying to teach a stranger,
                      what you have learned, but without the love that you have personally felt for it.

                      Oxymoron.

                      Being good at Biology, Dancing, Medicine, Trail Running, Math, Electronics, Art, Computers, Music,
                      still means little.

                      We get good at things we like,
                      it is not a big deal to be good at something.

                      Being Wise, is a Big Deal,
                      being able to Authentically and Nobly navigate live in a Dignified Fashion.

                      With wisdom, we can figure out how the world works,
                      the World is not a Mechanical Machine, now will it ever become a Political One,
                      it is a Conundrum of Human Conditions.

                      All else must yield,
                      it must.

                      It must,
                      until you are touching the fabric of the future with your very own fingertips.

                      Until,
                      you feel like a hero.

                      Until it is your voice, and your soul, and heart, and your works,
                      and your strength.

                      That make him, rise,
                      with certainty of knowing, you are correct.

                      Tired old man,
                      who has seen everything and heard every lie.

                      He&apos;s been a District Judge for more than he can remember,
                      but he has heard every world yo said.

                      And the moment you mentioned,
                      that it is Human Rights Day, he groaned.

                      And he stood downstairs,
                      keeping his hands warm with a cup of coffee.

                      And he stood there much longer than you could,
                      and it marked the end of his career.

                      But he never forgot your words,
                      because your words were filled with wisdom.

                      Because you searched for it,
                      because you fought for it.

                      Because you were courageous,
                      it all became crystal clear in your mind.

                      And more than moving a single judge,
                      you will grow to move a generation.

                      Grow to renew the search for meaning,
                      the Love of Wisdom.

                      You moved mountains,
                      you gave speeches long past your retirement.

                      As the cities of the future grew,
                      and as you grew.

                      And the life of wisdom made it so,
                      that your name and the symbols it stood for earned permanence in Human History.

                      Wisdom, is your right,
                      it is your first fight,
                      it is your greatest might.

                      Rise my friend,
                      rise to no end,
                      the world needs you to set the trend.</a></p>

                      outline their treasure and their national pride.

                      But reality is such,
                      that this does not matter much.

                      One can complain about this nation or that nation,
                      but that does not change the situation...

                      We are one,
                      one family under the sun.

                      Eventually Education, Foresight, Wisdom, and World Peace,
                      will bring us all together and the complaints will cease.

                      Until then, we must each remember that borders are useless,
                      they only divide and create a huge mess.

                      A border does not mark its people to be of any particular kind,
                      it only keeps different kinds of colorful groups apart.

                      It is not correct to be unhappy about a nation,
                      let us be unhappy about lack of safety, books and education.

                      Let us come together and stand against lack of Good Schools and Wisdom,
                      let us but complain about divisions and lack of peace and calm.

                      If there were no borders, there would be more friendship and love,
                      all nations United in Peace under the symbol of the white dove.

                      We are not different from one another,
                      a sister or brother from a different mother.

                      In the World of the Future we won&apos;t be divided at all,
                      people will forget why we needed a wall.</a></p>

                      and all you do matters.

                      As you rise,
                      you create a way for others to follow.

                      Struggle, like suffering,
                      is a gas that fills all the available space.

                      It is never easy for anybody,
                      the difference is in the choices we make and the aims we set.

                      The first Great Choice is to set off towards wisdom,
                      to continuously transcend our limits thorough out our entire existence.

                      One of the finest choices we can make,
                      is to Live Above Common Levels of Life.

                      There are no guarantees,
                      your choice to proceed forward is all the guarantee there is.

                      Our biological life is not finely crafted,
                      it is a result of fundamental principles of Physics and Chemistry.

                      But our mind, is up to us to shape,
                      hence Audio Books and Lectures and our inheritance from of Other Lives, Times, and Works.

                      You need not hurry,
                      but you do need to slow down so that you may read and write.

                      We each have a story to tell,
                      and many will follow a similar path to ours across the vastness of future.

                      They could use some advice,
                      a few fine words about rising, about what it is like to see the sun for the first time.

                      Do not let your readers suffer the same loneliness you did,
                      let them learn from you.

                      And the way you write,
                      is one thought at a time.

                      So as long as your write about your unlimited travels,
                      you never run out of the story to tell.

                      And every once in a while,
                      a poem will leap ahead of you.

                      The thought will arrive,
                      from the future before you get there.

                      You are connected to your future self,
                      no one can hold a stronger bond.

                      You are a being, with a mind and body, you are in the present,
                      but you exist across time.

                      Your Life Line, your Life Time,
                      The past you and the future you, are connected.

                      And just the same those who came before you,
                      and those who are yet to follow, are connected to you.

                      But you have to write your thoughts,
                      ...when you are rising in your childhood,
                      the children can understand it best.

                      In your early age, as you make your way,
                      as you learn to rise, and find your rhythm,
                      your readers will be in their twenties.

                      And then, forties, and then sixties, and eighties, and hundreds,
                      at no point in your life should you be ashamed to write,
                      or be shamed for writing.

                      Because if you can manage to hold your pen,
                      it is more than most others can.

                      One thought at a time,
                      help others understand how to climb.

                      Make all your struggles count for more,
                      show them how you fought for wisdom in your war.

                      Tell the world what you know,
                      so that others may safely follow.

                      Know that the first struggles sometimes mean more,
                      sometimes the hardest challenge is to get off the floor.

                      The first steps after all,
                      matter the most to those whose worlds may be seem small.

                      All steps matter and in many ways,
                      all lead to enlightenment, and the Sun&apos;s rays.</a></p>

                      if we are not knowledgeable enough to see where it is.

                      Working towards good grades rather than Empowering Wisdom,
                      actually works to shield what is broken about the world today.

                      Only real and meaningful, functional and powerful-education can grant us the tools needed,
                      if we don&apos;t have the necessary tools for thinking then we can&apos;t see enough.

                      One of Humanity&apos;s greatest challenges is in overcoming,
                      this ridiculous notion of minimum lowest-common-denominator education.

                      We are each to stand in relentless pursuit of excellence,
                      education is life long, volitional, deliberate and life saving.

                      The future of Earth depends on it,
                      many of us have felt the threat of Cold War and Mutually Assured Destruction,
                      we watched the Ozone Hole emerge out of greed and lack of wisdom.
                      we are witnessing species disappearing every day,
                      lack of understanding of climate change,
                      and basics of disease prevention.

                      This is happening not because people are evil,
                      but because they never received a meaningful education, never read enough books to break out and become inspired.

                      Many people do notice this,
                      and do take to videos, audio books and lectures,
                      and they do become moved.

                      They learn, and grasp a deeper nature of the thinking mistakes they made,
                      from simple topics like Raw Milk consumption, and the pseudo-scientific Homeopathy and Chiropractic Treatments,
                      to dangers of Vaccine Hesitancy and other Pseudoscienific Garbage they are able to become more realistic about other things.

                      But this is difficult, it is not as common as it should be,
                      and what an awful injustice it is to deny these basic facts of living.

                      This is the challenge we must overcome,
                      we tried organized education and with grades and incompetent teachers we witnessed generations of children being pushed into Poverty of Mind.

                      Grades, what a tragic idea,
                      and how easily will children convince themselves that they are not enough; not good enough.

                      How many teachers tried to tell their students that they are bad at learning,
                      and how many children became convinced of that, that they are not smart?

                      Where truth is, that we are all equally capable,
                      all capable of genius so as long as it is real kind and not the &quot;I am better than you kind&quot; like photographic memory
                      (which is fake, no one ever had it; people just said they did to look smart).

                      World&apos;s politicians are facing these flaws as well,
                      they can&apos;t tell if Homeopathy is real or not, not without a real education.

                      Today, there is nothing that can be done about people in authority lacking in education,
                      the only thing that can stop them is time.

                      And it is our job now,
                      that the new generation of Policy Makes does not suffer from inability to tell real from fantasy.

                      In the absence of teachers,
                      we become the teachers.

                      I challenge you my Dear Readers,
                      to books, to becoming a teacher, and a Great Being,
                      helping the world grow in health.

                      We have to help children understand that a life of fantasy,
                      is not a complete life, that it is our right to live in realty.

                      Our generation, must be the generation of the Well Read, of The Wise, of The Teachers,
                      with a clear vision of the future; we are not to fight, we are to learn and teach.

                      The children will grow up into a world where corruption of today,
                      has passed of old age, of its own toxic sickness.

                      The children must learn to be teachers as well,
                      bu they face even a greater task, the task of becoming Incorruptible Leaders.

                      The leaders the world hopes to see today,
                      those are the children that look up to us for guidance.

                      We must rise today.
                      Rise against lies and liars, manipulators and cheaters, leeches and big fat white lice,
                      we must rise against poverty, against fake education and the grades that connive children they are not enough.

                      We must rise, against every ongoing mistake,
                      every invisible wall,
                      and stand our ground.

                      Knowing that our world is the world of reality,
                      and that is the only world worthy of us.

                      With all our might, we are not to fight,
                      we are to live our lives and finally reach happiness,
                      but on our way there we are to learn, become wise, become teachers, and aim to become great beings.

                      Not only for our own dignity and to honor those we love,
                      but also for all the future yet to come.

                      May all the future generation read our works,
                      and determine that this year, was the first year of the new era they they hold so dearly.

                      That this year, was the year that future thinkers marked,
                      as The Day Humanity Entered Into The Age Of Wisdom.

                      therefore the current generations can be said to be the most important.

                      Much is to be said on the subject of the great mistakes of the most recent century,
                      and just as importantly much is to be said about the mistakes we are repeating.

                      History books are waiting to be read,
                      they will help us understand current events across all nations.

                      To correct things, however,
                      is much more difficult.

                      This is because we were born into the world long after things were put in motion,
                      and the people in charge have not been granted the needed wisdom to understand their role.

                      To put it simply,
                      it is too late to teach the blind or corrupt.

                      Individuals who take part in harming the world, or preventing it from growing,
                      are too far invested, too long gone to be helped.

                      And it is a matter of help.

                      Those who advertise products, that they know cause cancer or other illnesses, are sick, their minds are broken.
                      they all once had an opportunity to become heroes, but they didn&apos;t know it.

                      I think we can assume, that in most situations,
                      a human being will choose Goodness over Evil,
                      unless they lack the Wisdom to tell the difference between the two.

                      The solution to all out problems is to first understand that we were born too late into all this,
                      the momentum of Climate Change and Business as Usual, Mass Incarceration and Poverty was too high to be stopped by a singe generation.

                      But it is hardly a challenge for a Wiser World,
                      a world that helps children to wisdom so that they can become Great Beings come their middle age.

                      We can&apos;t say the word &quot;poverty&quot; and sound like it is a cruel world,
                      we have to make it clear that it is a broken world looking for New Heroes, New Intellectuals, and New Leaders.

                      We can&apos;t say the word &quot;prison&quot; and make it sound like that&apos;s where bad people go,
                      we have to show our pain, and speak about how no Human belongs in a cage, how they needed a fair start,
                      and how prisons can only make a bad person worse.

                      We can&apos;t talk about climate change as something that has no real solution in sight,
                      but rather we have to say that adults today are not educated well enough, their minds are not great enough to comprehend the scale of the problem.

                      The world in its complexity, made it so that all of these heartbreaking problems,
                      double as a challenge, an opportunity to not just grow in wisdom to fix these problems, but to grow in Greatness as well.

                      The mistakes of today,
                      when presented as such become an opportunity to help a generation grow far beyond what we perceived as our own limits.

                      Whenever there is a problem that is too great for a generation,
                      know for certain that multiple consecutive generations will fix it, in their hard earned wisdom.

                      My Friends,
                      this is yet another reason to take to Books and Audio Books,
                      to study best we can, so that we may teach.

                      We maybe just a chain link in a world with many problems,
                      but even a single chain-link keeps it all connected.

                      Slow down, I know you are working hard,
                      slow down to a speed that lets you read books,
                      read, learn, and rise to the challenge of inspiring generations to their greatness, and their destiny as teachers.

                      The momentum of the mistakes of today,
                      will lose force in proportion to our ability to inspire the younger generation to greatness;
                      our ability to show them just how important they are, to the past, the present, the future, how it is all inseparable together.</a></p>

                      is a broken world full of dark secrets.

                      The world can&apos;t progress forward,
                      if we are not learning.

                      Observations are very important,
                      but they are not on a large enough scale.

                      We need a steady stream from multiple reinforcing sources,
                      Audio Books and Lectures are exactly that kind of stream.

                      They are integrated works of art,
                      tightly compressed, well arranged.

                      If you are lucky it will be read by the author,
                      the chapters will flow together with feeling, pride and joy.

                      If you find a Memoir, or Travel/Adventure book, that makes you rest, that you enjoy, that makes you smirk.
                      You are bound to permanently inherit massive amount of knowledge, it really does not matter what the book is about.

                      Any story story you love can only add to you, it will reinforce you, make you better and stronger.

                      Our first great achievement is reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom,
                      and the reward is a Greater Mind.

                      Every person is capable of becoming, Profound and Wise,
                      it takes effort, it is a deliberate, volitional act.

                      If a person does not know: how big the world is,
                      they will never leave their city, or their small mind, behind.

                      We have to learn to slow down,
                      and live at such a speed that does not interfere with our inheritance of wisdom.

                      We can&apos;t deny ourselves knowledge,
                      and then run quickly forward.

                      Without constantly expanding your knowledge,
                      we may not be able to tell, which way forward, is.

                      Inheriting from lives and wisdom of other people, is a great super power.

                      And accepting responsibility for self education, is easily of of the greatest things we&apos;ll ever do.

                      Finally, the answer to that stupid question that people ask us when we are little,
                      &quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;,

                      Must not conjure up a picture of some career path.
                      There is only one correct answer, and it should be the same for us all:

                      &quot;I want to Become a Wise Being&quot;

                      Only in our wisdom can the World grow,
                      and especially in the wisdom of the youngest generation.

                      The children of today,
                      will run the entire Planet of Tomorrow.</a></p>

                    there is a moment when you go from observer to creator.

                    It is similar to how you arrive in a new city,
                    at first you are unsure, but eventually it becomes your home town.

                    In politics, politicians so through something similar,
                    but it is a mistake, they become comfortable around manipulators,
                    and get comfortable with manipulating, propagating the blight.

                    In the world of books, the authors that resonate with you,
                    become your friends, Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Dan Brown,
                    they become family and you get to know them in your own way.

                    In world adventures, it is called going native, or emanating mana,
                    one moment you are an outsider, and the next you are riding a bull to work,
                    where you spend your days working hard on digging new wells,
                    hurrying to finish before your visa expires and you have get back to the loud and filthy city.

                    When knowledge becomes internalized, it becomes wisdom,
                    you become able to synthesize more knowledge out of what you already know,
                    some call it Enlightenment.

                    It all cases, it is natural, human, simple and easy to get to,
                    it is not rare, it is not a power granted only to special people,
                    it is a power that makes people more special.

                    If you read enough audio books that move you in the same direction,
                    you&apos;ll go from listening about something to becoming a participant in thinking about it.

                    It is a feeling so powerful at first,
                    that some become convinced they are geniuses,
                    and have deeper knowledge

                    &quot;Nope! that&apos;s just your first tipping point dude,
                    keep going though, because you are just about as amazing as you think you are, don&apos;t stop learning&quot;.

                    The more tipping points, and plateaus,
                    upon which we rests as we move towards the sunny parts of our mountain range.

                    The more capable we become, the more we can synthesize,
                    and the more of the things we synthesize slowly do become unique and amazing.

                    Finally, the more we know,
                    the easier it is to understand other people&apos;s works,
                    we begin sharing more and more with other creators.

                    That&apos;s Real Education,
                    we become specialists in our own unique corners of the world,

                    Eventually we too get stung by the urge to share what we know,
                    both the unique little discoveries or contributions we made,
                    and in memoirs that describe all the twisty little passages that got us there.</a></p>

                    Hypatia, Socrates, Giordano Bruno; that is always the Noblest start,
                    you start in the beginning.

                    Then,
                    Books, Audio Books, School Library, Public Library, Every Library.

                    You learn and rise, to improve on their works.
                    then Ayn Rand, Avital Ronell, Martha Nussbaum, everyone, Every Great Mind.

                    But also your mind,
                    knowing that it is your Sacred Right to protect its integrity,
                    completeness,
                    beauty.

                    Those who are attacking you, belittling you, threatening you, expecting you to serve,
                    those who make you feel fear, dread, pain,
                    will destroy you - if you let them.

                    Resist, peacefully, like the greatest of warriors,
                    see their rage and anger as a flaw in them,
                    and your inner-peace as a superpower in you.

                    Know, with all certainty,
                    that you are The Hope,
                    and The Dream of the Greatest Minds, awakened thus far.

                    It was you that Hypatia, Socrates, Giordano Bruno sent the last of their Hopes and Everlasting Love to.

                    The Little, You.

                    The Thinker, The Dreamer, The Wanderer, The Watcher and Observer.

                    They cared not for Prime Ministers, and Presidents, or Royalty.

                    Only For The Other Saints.

                    Only for the Little Ones.

                    You.

                    You are not to be a victim of indoctrination into cultures of Fat White Lice.

                    Let the lice, age,
                    let that be the main strategy.

                    In the World of Clarity,
                    the one Constructed by Hope and Dream,
                    of the Greatest of Warriors who have made great strides through he greatest of trials.

                    We begin by learning to Prevent Problems,
                    prevent them before they begin and grow unfixable.

                    We begin in a world that sees it self across time,
                    and recognizes that a prolonged failure in leadership will become a cause for Dark Ages.

                    Dark ages, where multiple generations will have to wait for the politicians to step down of old age,
                    so that we may take their place and work for All Humanity,
                    including those who are yet to come.

                    No one generation is to force another into inheritance of problems like Mass Incarceration,
                    Fake Schools and Education, few Worthy Professors in deed.

                    We are not passing on burdens onto You,
                    we inherited them too,
                    they just can&apos;t be fixed today.

                    We are teaching You to rise and learn to prevent things - rather than attempt to fix them directly,
                    we are asking You to teach your Little Ones to carry on this Great Tradition of Infinite Foresight.

                    The aim is World Peace,
                    and Multicultural Convergence on Wisdom.

                    All Human Beings,
                    rising to the challenge of becoming; Great Beings,
                    by inheriting wisdom from Audio Books, Internet Lectures and Videos, Books and Libraries, Museums, and Galleries,
                    Great Minds form all across History.

                    The world you see around you now,
                    with pointless Wars and Murders,
                    Prisons, Secret Prisons, Concentration Camps,
                    Torture and Enhanced Interrogation,
                    Helpless or Lying Politicians,
                    the plague of &quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;,
                    Famine, Poverty, Broken Welfare, Heartbreaking Minimum wage,
                    Ten Million Of Us Behind Bars.

                    Is what a world becomes when people... Forget.

                    When they forget,
                    that we can&apos;t grow without Knowledge and Wisdom,
                    and that our proper upright posture is that of a Great Being.

                    We just need to remember,
                    and we will rise,
                    and continue on this time.

                    One Family,
                    Across All Time,
                    All Generations,
                    One Wisdom.

                    of what one thinks today,
                    and another tomorrow morning.

                    But, the world belongs,
                    to all the future generations,
                    we are just temporary residents.

                    We are not to treat Earth,
                    as if it only belonged to us.

                    We are to stop lying to children,
                    that memorization is education.

                    We are to stop keeping in them in rows,
                    dividing time into squares,
                    and subjects into meaninglessness,
                    in a one-for-all curriculum of poverty of mind.

                    Respect, is a reward, so don&apos;t demand it,
                    it is not a demand anybody can make.

                    And we are to stop thinking in short term,
                    rather than keeping ten million people in cages,
                    we need to practice Crime Prevention and put an End to Poverty first.

                    Rather than economic fairy-tales,
                    mutually assured destruction, and blind wars,
                    we need to connect together across borders and in wisdom.

                    There is very little prestige to be gained,
                    from hard work and beautiful career, tailored suits,
                    and expensive cafes if we are not paying attention to all the problems children face.

                    That&apos;s just reality, the respect of the younger generations cannot be granted for free,
                    children can&apos;t believe nonsense no matter how convincing the teachers,
                    and the world won&apos;t grow without Wisdom.

                    The world will wait,
                    for several consecutive generations of Wise Beings,
                    to converge on good ideas, in Peace and Earned Respect.

                    It will wait.

                    It need not be hard work, you know,
                    reading books or listening to audio books comes so easy,
                    and there is so much we learn - we inherit lifetimes of knowledge.

                    Though it is Beautiful, and Healing, and Wonderful,
                    Wisdom is not just for us, it is for all the future.

                    Many of the problems that overwhelm us,
                    really can&apos;t be repaired, the career politicians are lying.

                    The big problems,
                    can only be prevented with Foresight, and Love, and Wisdom,
                    and require hard work by multiple generations

                    And that can only begin with Real Education,
                    and Real Love of Wisdom.

                    Please rise to the challenge,
                    and become a great being.</a></p>
