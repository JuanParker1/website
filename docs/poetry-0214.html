                    <p>It felt so healthy to sit down to the first version,</p>
                    <p>the promise of creating a program that will change the world felt amazing.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They settled on trusty bare bones <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a>,</p>
                    <p>and the first routes they put in were view and edit.</p>

                    <p>Carl Sagan once said, that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,</p>
                    <p>you must first invent the universe.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> the inventor of WikiWiki,
                    <p>has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>With just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,</p>
                    <p>in the most simplest way possible.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,</p>
                    <p>the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,</p>
                    <p>it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,</p>
                    <p>the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,</p>
                    <p>and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,</p>
                    <p>by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,</p>
                    <p>every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,</p>
                    <p>and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,</p>
                    <p>this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,</p>
                    <p>basically a blank Wikipedia.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>So now came the big question,</p>
                    <p>which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,</p>
                    <p>after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,</p>
                    <p>cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>

                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.</p>
                    <p>and they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>Adding user support had to come in next,</p>
                    <p>just like every city had a page, so did every user.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,</p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">Alice and Bob</a>.
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Out in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,</p>
                    <p>and she named the malicious politician Mallory.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Alice and Bob represented computer programs,</p>
                    <p>they were chatbots.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,</p>
                    <p>they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The bots weren&apos;t really inspired by anything other than old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> programs but there was a beautiful line of code,</p>
                    <p>that one of the leads always looked at, <a href="https://github.com/hubotio/hubot-rules/blob/master/src/rules.js#L26">line 26</a> in a sample script of github&apos;s hubot.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>The bots were special,</p>
                    <p>they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>As a whole they already created a very simple,</p>
                    <p>but living simulation.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,</p>
                    <p>the bot actually got its information from Detroit&apos;s own weather service.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,</p>
                    <p>that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,</p>
                    <p>that made working on the system fun.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But by far the most special thing about bots,</p>
                    <p>was that they could be replaced by a real human,</p>
                    <p>by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In the next release of the program,</p>
                    <p>the girls focused on enhancing this feature.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,</p>
                    <p>but when a real person took over for an account,</p>
                    <p>they could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Even in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,</p>
                    <p>that a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>As with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,</p>
                    <p>but it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,</p>
                    <p>and in the end large cities would go online within weeks,</p>
                    <p>because it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.</p>

                    <p>Becoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,</p>
                    <p>it becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.</p>

                    <p>There is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,</p>
                    <p>that contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Lack of education must be recognized as the highest threat,
to the security of our world.
We are not to force children into poverty,
by selling a mere impression of knowledge.
Privacy is to be recognized,
as a Basic Human right.
And those of you who hate, or just laugh,
know in no uncertain terms, that you will be forgotten.
The younger generations are sacred,
and they are to be honored by free and effective education.
They are to be granted privacy,
free acres to any and all educational materials and all books, including audio books.
Those of you who are looking to turn a profit,
by dangling education as a carrot, will be forgotten in disgrace.
Rest of my note,
is for the Children.
Know that parents are often victims to their cognitive biases,
out of lack of education, out of never having met a real teacher.
Know, with all certainty that borders are wrong,
they are a symptom of poison that our biases drive into us when unchecked.
The effects of our cognitive biases burn brightest and spread fastest,
when fueled by lack of education; poverty of mind and wallet.
The world of today is choking on chaos born from lack of education and wisdom,
prestigious positions are taken up by lying pretenders whose only aim is to fake it until they make it.
They are unaware of their lack of education,
they do not know what wisdom is, most of them just want to feed to no end.
Only in wisdom can the world become what it is mean to be,
one home, for us all, our entire family.
We are only divided by levels of education,
in Wisdom we are one, and we are each Unique and Infinitely Beautiful.
You are not so serve, you are the future,
you are to lead the world to unity and wisdom.
In poverty certain imaginary things spread in our minds like viruses,
they are fueled by fear, darkness, uncertainty and lack of education.
They become a beacon to those who like to frighten,
and take enlightenment away with threats punishment for no other reason than to tower and feed.
It your great responsibility to set yourself free,
do not be a slave to a cult.
You are meant to become a Wise Being by listening to and reading books,
and you are meant to become a Great Being by helping your loved ones and even some of your enemies towards enlightenment and freedom.
If a school is not teaching you,
then it is not a school, and you have to find a real one.
Do not become tricked by a mere impression of education,
you don&apos;t need a job, you need to be a business owner, and a leader.
We need you to stand as competition to overpriced medicine and companies that violate human rights for profit,
to corporations that cannot have hearts and slick talking psychopaths, who will never see value in helping you.
Especially those who announce themselves with,
with bite sized lies.
Build you own schools out of books,
may you share libraries.
May you build schools free of shame, judgment, pressure to cheat, and threat punishment,
or prison - which is what being held back is.
Share your wisdom amongst each other,
tell the world about your parents in audiobooks and torrents of videos.
Question poverty, question profit maximization,
and the betrayals of privacy, leadership, and even organized education.
The internet is for you to connect and see that we are all the same,
we all love your humor, and relish in and learn much your insults.
The internet will remain in place as we all wait for you to connect the world together,
we built it for you and we will protect it until you make the borders that divide humanity, irrelevant.
We fill and re-fill libraries with inspiration and wisdom to help you grow faster,
to help you gain visions with clarity that is not available to us - and it is working.
Always reject status quo and question authority,
especially their biases and down to their marrow until all they have left to speak is, that ounce of truth they do know.
Without wisdom, desperate men can only blindly-and-automatically, repeat history&apos;s mistakes,
those who have no wisdom have no authority over you, YOU ARE THE FUTURE.
We are to make Audio Books out of Love,
not wars out of incompetence, fear and hate.
Happiness is not something you can pursue, that&apos;s impossible,
nor life is a journey to some imaginary destination, we can only return to the nothingness we emerged from.
Happiness must ensue, and it will only appear in lives of wisdom,
it is not a feeling can capture and hold, it is a gravity that will overwhelm and lovingly crush you every day, forever.
The road ahead of you, is extremely long,
and requires hundreds of years of work.
But the future is beautiful,
it is more beautiful than any of us alive today can imagine.
Take to audio books on the subjects of Adventure, Philosophy, Wisdom, Science, Greatness and Growing Up, immediately,
and take what you learn to school, do not let teachers trick you into cramming and blame it on you.
The world is standing still, the sooner you stand up for Wisdom and deliver,
the sooner the future will come.
You are the teachers now.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Greatness is not a question of having it or not,
it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.
We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,
to save the world from mediocrity and hate.
All battles for goodness are already won,
and before you know it, your great task will be done.
But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,
set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.
You never really fight in a good war,
the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.
But Greatness will call to you non the less,
it will ask you to speak about Wisdom, Love, Growing Up, and Kindness.
You see many Great Beings smile when facing wrath,
that powerful joy comes from the certainty of walking the right path.
Those who walk the wrong path, age quickly and fade,
and history books will soon-enough reveal their charade.
The Noble Greatness within us all is forged to last,
and the opportunities ahead are as beautiful as vast.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Any adventure,
is an adventure.
You don&apos;t have to go far,
though walking will be involved.
Adventures within adventures,
are even more fun.
That&apos;s where you go somewhere,
and then explore something else from there.
It is like going to Ludington,
but then marching around Nordhouse Dunes.
Or visiting White Fish Point,
and then trying to find fossils on the beach.
Or even going to the mall with your friends,
and then just people watching instead.
One definition of tiny adventures,
is going somewhere and then learning something new.
But you see, in this modern age we live in now,
this is a lot more exciting than it sounds, because of Audio Books.
Though you maybe walking to the store for a change,
your Audio Book, may transport you to the Appalachian Trail.
There are other things that can spice up your adventures,
it all depends how creative you are.
For example, back in January 2014,
during the gorgeous -16 Fahrenheit Polar Vortex weather in Michigan.
With all the warnings as not to go outside,
and stay home, and drink hot chocolate.
I put on all my clothes, all at once,
and hurried out, for an hour-and-a-half-long expedition.
I wasn&apos;t in want for anything,
so I figured I might as well get some little beef jerky sausages.
It didn&apos;t seem as cold as everyone made it out to be,
but it did make my sausages; as frosty, as my little adventure fantastic.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Time for all of us to rise,
to fuel that which is greatest within us.
It is how we change the world with our works,
that matters the most in the end.
It is almost certainly a very small book,
one that will sit along side a smartphone.
And it is a book of answers,
that helps the children to real life.
Let us open our books
by undoing burdens:
&quot;Whatever trouble brought you to my book, child,
know that there are few people
that would have acted differently
in circumstances similar to yours.&quot;
And then carefully, let us share,
in the limited number of pages that we have,
what has moved us the most.
Without our hard earned wisdom,
they don&apos;t really have a chance at not making the same mistakes.
Who else is going to teach them if not us,
what Socrates said was only meant for the age he grew up in.
We need to repeat it anew,
nearer the culture of the children.
We have to help them understand,
that old age is a privileged denied to many.
So as long as we take to living in pursuit if wisdom,
and it is never to late to start, aging is a good thing.
Let us not have the children start at the same height we stated,
let us spare them the aches we went through, may our aches count for more.
Let us show the younger generations that we are rising,
that we are building a better world albeit slowly.
The world can&apos;t be replaced,
it must be transformed.
Just like a ship can&apos;t be replaced,
but can be transformed by updating it, board by board.
Let us show them that part of the meaning of their existence,
is a lasting legacy of wisdom.
The sooner they start,
the more beautiful their rise.
And the other part is Happiness,
out of Wisdom, out of Strength.
The meaning of life comes with Wisdom,
as our mind becomes more powerful for all the good ideas it gathers.
We have to help the children to understand,
that they belong to a Universal Culture, that they are Citizens of the World.
That all the things that change based on geographic location,
are but traditions.
Only that which remains regardless of where they are born,
is their true culture.
We have to get them to help each other as they grow,
to reach out to each other across borders.
The borders that dive us,
borders are just the products of small and primitive minds.
The future belongs to the children,
not those who gained authority by pretending.
There is hope for a more just and transparent world,
but it requires that we all stand in relentless pursuit of wisdom.
A liar will always win,
except when it comes to the wise
The wise will easily recognize the uneducated fool,
taking on his pleasing shapes.
Let us help the younger generations, to wisdom,
by telling them about Philosophers and their Love and Pursuit of Wisdom.
Let us pass on only the good ideas,
and commit the bad ones to history books as cautionary tales.
A life is a work of art, it paints it self day by day,
to create a beautiful picture, our legacy.
Life is best lived when what we learned yesterday,
adds to help us become a little bit wiser today.
The energy and the force for it all comes from
from watching our contributions help the world grow.
The new generations starting, not at zero,
but at the heights that we bought them to, by our own deliberate pursuit of wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">A hole in the window curtain,
lets a stray ray of light in.
The light displays a blurry image,
of what is outside, a pin hole camera.
As the beam travels along the wall,
he can imagine the entire solar system.
He knows the planet spins and rotates,
by inference from Jupiter Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
And now slowly the light,
reaches an old crystal vase.
There is a rainbow,
the beam of light is unfurled.
He&apos;s counting the colors,
and a violin plays.
And A becomes Blue,
B is Indigo,
C turns Violet,
D is Red,
E becomes Orange,
F is Yellow,
and G glows Green.
He watched the whole thing,
in bed, in silence.
He knows now he will turn led to gold,
let the Clockwork Universe, Unfold.
You are so lucky that you live in an age where you can pull up,
Newton&apos;s book on opticks with the click of a link.
In most cases you can&apos;t be stopped by by research you have not yet conducted,
and you don&apos;t have to invent much from scratch, you just need a science book.
You have the same mental powers as Newton and all the others,
but you DO, have to slow down, and think about things just like they did.
Learning or catching up,
is an Art.
Even though you have all the answers before you,
you can&apos;t read it all at once.
You have to follow one thread at a time,
our minds need time to comprehend and rearrange.
Like the body of a dancer needs time to adapt,
we have to learn at a precise pace, and sequence.
It is very similar to learning the roads of a new city,
you never say to your self I am not smart enough to navigate.
Because you never listen to confusing directions,
you just follow a single road at your own pace and eventually master it.
See, Newton learned from works of Galileo,
who passed away the year Newton was born.
And although Newton never did convert led to gold,
the led of his pencil, became even more precious.
Many of Newton&apos;s works,
must have fascinated Henry Cavendish.
And Einstein no doubt appreciated the modes of thinking these men revealed,
even though he never figured out his Spooky Action at a Distance.
They all learned much along the way,
and each became wise for trying.
