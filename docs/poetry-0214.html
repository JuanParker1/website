                    <p>It felt so healthy to sit down to the first version,</p>
                    <p>the promise of creating a program that will change the world felt amazing.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They settled on trusty bare bones <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a>,</p>
                    <p>and the first routes they put in were view and edit.</p>

                    <p>Carl Sagan once said, that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,</p>
                    <p>you must first invent the universe.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> the inventor of WikiWiki,
                    <p>has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>With just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,</p>
                    <p>in the most simplest way possible.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,</p>
                    <p>the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,</p>
                    <p>it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,</p>
                    <p>the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,</p>
                    <p>and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,</p>
                    <p>by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,</p>
                    <p>every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,</p>
                    <p>and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,</p>
                    <p>this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,</p>
                    <p>basically a blank Wikipedia.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>So now came the big question,</p>
                    <p>which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,</p>
                    <p>after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,</p>
                    <p>cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>

                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.</p>
                    <p>and they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>Adding user support had to come in next,</p>
                    <p>just like every city had a page, so did every user.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,</p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">Alice and Bob</a>.
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Out in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,</p>
                    <p>and she named the malicious politician Mallory.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Alice and Bob represented computer programs,</p>
                    <p>they were chatbots.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,</p>
                    <p>they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The bots weren&apos;t really inspired by anything other than old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> programs but there was a beautiful line of code,</p>
                    <p>that one of the leads always looked at, <a href="https://github.com/hubotio/hubot-rules/blob/master/src/rules.js#L26">line 26</a> in a sample script of github&apos;s hubot.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>The bots were special,</p>
                    <p>they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>As a whole they already created a very simple,</p>
                    <p>but living simulation.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,</p>
                    <p>the bot actually got its information from Detroit&apos;s own weather service.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,</p>
                    <p>that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,</p>
                    <p>that made working on the system fun.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But by far the most special thing about bots,</p>
                    <p>was that they could be replaced by a real human,</p>
                    <p>by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In the next release of the program,</p>
                    <p>the girls focused on enhancing this feature.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,</p>
                    <p>but when a real person took over for an account,</p>
                    <p>they could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Even in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,</p>
                    <p>that a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>As with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,</p>
                    <p>but it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,</p>
                    <p>and in the end large cities would go online within weeks,</p>
                    <p>because it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.</p>

                    <p>Becoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,</p>
                    <p>it becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.</p>

                    <p>There is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,</p>
                    <p>that contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">The Universe works in very honest ways,
when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.
When we face impossible problems,
someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.
When governments become too complex,
the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.
When liars start winning all the battles,
your wisdom will become even more precious.
A senator&apos;s boy brought into positions of authority,
by means of favors, shortcuts, and being told what to say, can&apos;t become wise.
Wisdom grows from within our authenticity, dignity, and love,
from clarity of vision, and being moved by generations of giants.
Authenticity helps us up,
wisdom on top of wisdom, plateau by plateau onward to greatness.
Inauthenticity, can only build temporary things,
that soon collapse under their own weight for lack of foundation.
Just because you feel hopelessness,
when you dream about making the world a better place../
It does not mean you should stop loving, thinking, writing,
when the future comes asking: what is next?
Your books are to be complete, beloved, and held in high esteem,
your works must move the world.
All that is true, and worthy of human kind,
requires generations of work, same inspiration, same vision.
May your works serve as the first stepping stone,
a source of rules that will keep Humanity Safe and Sound.
May your works inspire countless generations,
across all the world&apos;s nations.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We have a tendency to take things for granted,
and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.
It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.
The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.
Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.
The world has also become more interconnected,
those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.
Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,
all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.
There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,
the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.
All the fantasies and walls will fade, today&apos;s problem with borders and cults,
is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,
to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.
We are infinite in our minds,
just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.
Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,
something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.
It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,
and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.
This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,
this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.
And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,
the sciences call to everyone.
Personalized education doesn&apos;t really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,
as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.
Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,
and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.
We don&apos;t learn the way schools teach,
we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.
By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,
problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.
A more knowledgeable world,
is a more capable world.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each generation, including yours, Dear Reader,
is charged with figuring out, what is wrong.
Previous generations discovered many wrongs,
Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.
Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,
we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.
The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,
is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.
Liars everywhere, in the blindness caused by lack of education,
are easily out-competing generations of beings who dedicated their lives to the betterment of Human Kind.
Children are forced to memorize and pretend to learn to get good grades,
and hope to go to colleges and universities that hardly live up to their promises.
Their job search, and school loans,
the way they are treated from interview to retirement does not do them justice.
The younger generations are the Sacred Hope and Future of Human Hind,
but they are now exploited by old fat lice who cannot stop feeding even if their life depends on it.
The teachers in their haste to bring a little paycheck home have lost the respect for students,
professors now sell home-made textbooks as ineffective as their lectures, and universities.
The children can see all this,
they understand the minds of these failures.
They merely need to ask:
&quot;How would I have to think, and how low would I have to sink, to do as they do.&quot;
Humanity requires a real educational system to effectively pass knowledge between generations,
when we finally create it, we will see blind stupidity and all the evils it fuels, fade.
My friends, this is not a difficult project,
we come together to record video lectures, write and narrate books.
We pay,
for outstanding contributions and translations of these lectures.
That payment,
is the grade.
We create a massively multiplying and overlapping global educational system,
that has no structure, and countless redundant paths towards knowledge, excellence and wisdom.
Those paths,
are the diploma.
Companies that show compassion, worth and balance,
inspect these paths in search of talent.
Even so, students are encouraged to build multi-founder start-ups,
throughout the world and their lives.
This world school, is not an neat addition to this world,
this school: Becomes Our World.
It becomes our point of convergence on World Peace,
and the Library of Ideas worth keeping.
The fundamentally broken naysayers will come,
as the erosion of the good ideas and propagation of war, poverty, and all other bad ideas is their food.
But those who stand against Prosperity, Unity, Knowledge, Wisdom and World Peace,
are just an animated rotting corpse that needs to be left behind in the poverty and desperation they once exploited to their advantage.
For the sake of the future generations,
let us rise against evil and mediocrity.
May we abandon all that moves against the grain of reality,
and all that is fake, ineffective, and lacking positive, real, and permanent results.
Let us cradle the future generations in Knowledge, in Wisdom, and in Greatness,
and honor them and their challenges, with World Peace.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We can&apos;t have a standardized education,
because that would require a standardized life.
A life in which we are only passionate about
what we are told to be passionate about.
A life, where memorization,
does suffice.
My friends, the standardization of your existence,
is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.
A standardized existence is one
where your mind is taken from you.
Just like you recoil at the thought of a standardized breakfast,
the words standardized education should make you feel sick!
Even if you could learn by being taught like a little bird is fed,
how could you allow someone to pick the knowledge for your mind?
Allowing someone to insert standardized lessons into your mind is disgusting,
you are a unique and sacred being, born a genius and meant to be driven to wisdom and greatness.
You are meant to be the hope and dreams of all the past generations,
school, job, career, retirement and some promise of world travel is not how real life works.
The people in charge of creating early schools might not have had the opportunity
to create schools that are capable of inspiring the students to great heights.
Since, we have only updated that imperfect first attempt at mass education,
we lost the original dream of helping the world become Knowledgeable and Wise.
Today, teachers create cookie cutter lessons and matching tests,
that they expect you to cram for, in what has now become a Mockery of Real Education.
Standardization is evil and dangerous, it shows a total misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
it is a dangerous waste of time, that often destroys joy, uniqueness, talent, and other colorful predispositions.
Teachers can only help students to books,
they need to focus on creating and recording quality video lectures.
The greatest education that can be given to student is one afforded by student exchange programs,
beyond that it must be a path they pick; by choosing the materials that interest them.
A standardized education does not have enough depth to help the student grow,
it can only slow them down and restrict them.
An ordinary teacher is one, even a classroom and school is one,
and cannot reach a unique student in a way that they are ready for.
But copies of video lectures, audio books, interactive games, and books,
can! reach every student, and just at the right place in their development.
The world is changing at an increasingly faster pace,
the brittle ideas behind original standardized education never quite lived up to their promise.
Let us work towards replacing standardized education
with life-long personalized education.
Education that drives a student to Authenticity, Knowledge, Independence, Entrepreneurship, and Wisdom,
and not the curse of an uninspired existence born of broken promises, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and depression.</span>

we are full of genius and imagination, and impossible dreams.
We have to take good care for that,
and use our Dignity and Nobility to transcend all limits, and beyond.
There is a very tiny probability,
that we maybe all the intelligence and impossible dreams that the universe has ever seen.
Either way, we are royals, we are special and beyond impossible,
our ability to learn, to out-learn, to out-think, to abstract, is infinite.
We created these little schools that double as babysitters, and distractions,
but we need to make them second to our real education.
And our real education comes from about a thousand books we pick on our own,
and listen and read to throughout our entire life, noting must interfere with that.
You just need to take one step to get the taste for wisdom,
listen to top ten adventure and travel and or hiking or jogging audio books.
The way your spirit grows from taking part in other peoples adventure,
will show you, by subtle analogy, what the countless other steps will help you become.
A wise and great being, adventurer, some kind of an amazing genius,
and a beacon of hope, and light of inspiration, and love.
The lessons you choose with your own heart and mind,
are far more important than the lessons others are trying to make you cram for.
Books will grant you wisdom that will help you avoid regrets,
they will enhance your decision making and long term visions.
Books belong to you,
their wisdom is your intellectual inheritance.</span>
