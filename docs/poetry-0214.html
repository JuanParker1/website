                    <p>It felt so healthy to sit down to the first version,</p>
                    <p>the promise of creating a program that will change the world felt amazing.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They settled on trusty bare bones <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a>,</p>
                    <p>and the first routes they put in were view and edit.</p>

                    <p>Carl Sagan once said, that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,</p>
                    <p>you must first invent the universe.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> the inventor of WikiWiki,
                    <p>has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>With just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,</p>
                    <p>in the most simplest way possible.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,</p>
                    <p>the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,</p>
                    <p>it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,</p>
                    <p>the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,</p>
                    <p>and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,</p>
                    <p>by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,</p>
                    <p>every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,</p>
                    <p>and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,</p>
                    <p>this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,</p>
                    <p>basically a blank Wikipedia.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>So now came the big question,</p>
                    <p>which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,</p>
                    <p>after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,</p>
                    <p>cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>

                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.</p>
                    <p>and they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>Adding user support had to come in next,</p>
                    <p>just like every city had a page, so did every user.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,</p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">Alice and Bob</a>.
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Out in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,</p>
                    <p>and she named the malicious politician Mallory.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Alice and Bob represented computer programs,</p>
                    <p>they were chatbots.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,</p>
                    <p>they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The bots weren&apos;t really inspired by anything other than old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> programs but there was a beautiful line of code,</p>
                    <p>that one of the leads always looked at, <a href="https://github.com/hubotio/hubot-rules/blob/master/src/rules.js#L26">line 26</a> in a sample script of github&apos;s hubot.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>The bots were special,</p>
                    <p>they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>As a whole they already created a very simple,</p>
                    <p>but living simulation.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,</p>
                    <p>the bot actually got its information from Detroit&apos;s own weather service.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,</p>
                    <p>that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,</p>
                    <p>that made working on the system fun.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But by far the most special thing about bots,</p>
                    <p>was that they could be replaced by a real human,</p>
                    <p>by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In the next release of the program,</p>
                    <p>the girls focused on enhancing this feature.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,</p>
                    <p>but when a real person took over for an account,</p>
                    <p>they could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Even in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,</p>
                    <p>that a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>As with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,</p>
                    <p>but it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,</p>
                    <p>and in the end large cities would go online within weeks,</p>
                    <p>because it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.</p>

                    <p>Becoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,</p>
                    <p>it becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.</p>

                    <p>There is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,</p>
                    <p>that contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Education in the context of an individual is the path to wisdom and greatness,
in the context of the whole world, however, education is a path to World Peace.
Education is a very unusual thing,
it enhances everything it can touch.
To borrow from movies,
education is our loading program.
To borrow from computers,
education is our operating system.
Without education, we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,
we end up living in villages and inventing gods to help with harvest and afterlife.
Organized and mandatory education is a recent invention,
it works up to middle school where teachers begin hiding inexperience behind abstractions.
When teaching a class of multiple students there is only time for lowest common denominators,
everything gets hurried along and those who can&apos;t understand something begin memorizing.
Within a few years everyone is temporarily memorizing everything to be sure they graduate,
those who try to learn, are graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.
Nobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,
and teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.
That is not education,
that is memorization, acting.
Our loading program does not load,
our operating system does not initialize.
System crashes,
and fathers eagerly send their boys to kill boys of other fathers.
Politics becomes infested with pretenders, actors, con-men, and simple liars,
voters simply don&apos;t think about electing people who show wisdom, who share books.
Lack of modern knowledge and the stress it begets will slow people down,
it will be difficult to become wise, it may not be possible to become great.
Failure to propagate modern knowledge, seems to take the shape of,
an uneducated majority, and a tiny educated minority without any voting power.
Once the failure of education takes hold,
nothing can be done to fix the anomalies that occur afterwards.
The only way to help things along is to avoid the emergence of anomalies in the first place,
and that means having a functional educational system.
If it is not possible for a nation to teach its children,
if the dream of organized, mandatory and standardized education is not realistic.
Personalized computer based, self education must be put in its place,
the transition can be made easy by transitioning from grades to money, credits, or bonds.
The initial computer based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,
a little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.
I write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,
but what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.
We are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other&apos;s beliefs based on color of skin,
they come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.
We have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,
of someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.
We have two nations that feature concentration camps,
and the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.
All of this is happening because of failure of schooling,
inability of politicians to build.
Now, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,
which deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.
We can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation&apos;s future,
and that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.
Let us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,
countries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.
Students in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,
and the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.
After all what is more prestigious than the child&apos;s real knowledge,
a child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.
Making some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,
and it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.
Graduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can&apos;t be erased with bankruptcy,
but with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.
The cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,
this is what it means to have a country.
What we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,
and research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.
We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,
where it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.
We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,
that sometimes make children die of starvation.
Humanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,
it has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.
For those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,
take a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.
Initially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,
would set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.
Call it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,
in process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.
Out of Love and Wisdom,
out of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.
And my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,
what would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">The best way to win against a liar, is to never meet one,
the simplest way to &quot;win&quot; is not to play their game.
This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,
liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.
One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,
they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn&apos;t cause much headache.
But it, looking like an expensive medicine, and costing like one,
when people felt it in their system, they automatically assumed it was working.
This is still going on, and when I was a teenager I actually bought a skin cleanser,
at a pharmacy, in the US, that in no uncertain terms, stated that this was homeopathic medicine,
Home and medicine, sounded good to me,
and it seemed to have been a gentle soap, but it was just the cheapest thing that they could possibly put in a tube.
I checked the top three pharmacies in the US in 2020, and heart-breakingly,
they all continue selling homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
Knowledge and Wisdom, and the path it entails,
is the most wonderful and safest way to avoid all this nonsense.
Because once you become more knowledgeable than the liar,
you will be able to hear them bending words, and twisting stories, the way your Mum was able to pick up on subtle cues when you were lying as a baby.
Now, past some point in an education, many, or perhaps most people, front healthy skepticism first,
not because they assume everyone is a liar, but because they wonder if someone might not have tricked themselves into a falsehood like I did with my homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
More than that, when I was a teenager, and someone asked me if Mokele-mbembe existed,
I would whole heatedly, and with all the love in my heart, say:
&quot;I hope so, after all, it is not a question of their existence, is it now? They used to exist millions of years ago.
It is a question of whether or not there is one or two, left in Rhodesia.&quot; - with a heavy and hairy accent, whilst bouncing my unibrow up an down.
Anybody asking me about cryptozoology was better off,
fronting mountains of skepticism first - the brontosaurus was my favorite dinosaur!
And get this, Brontosaurus is no longer the same thunder lizard we are all familiar with,
it was a misclassification, the dinosaur that you think of as Brontosaurus is actually called Apatosaurus now.
In context of liars, which are pretty damn scary, and only get more frightening as they come together in groups,
...searching for forgiveness, reinforcement and easy pickings to whatever their disorder is; we need to take to knowledge and wisdom as soon as possible.
Middle school, is a pretty good time to start learning for real,
and start climbing over everyone&apos;s heads, to get ahead of things.
Books narrated by their authors,
are an especially precious gift of knowledge.
Bill Bryson has some nice and funny books that help people grow,
A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, and In a Sunburned Country, are beautiful.
But it is best that you start with what moves you,
look at various best seller lists, and keep an eye on non-fiction of you can.
And climb, keep searching for that next book that will agree with you,
and explore everything, explore the world, the trails, the libraries, all the places of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.
It does not take many books to get ahead of liars,
it only takes a few more to get ahead of those that don&apos;t know they are causing harm.
And here the handful of your beloved Memoirs, Biographies, and adventure books,
will transform, to your Sword and Shield, and you will fell many a monster and dragon, onward to a cheerful future.
Start learning on your own, not just to avoid liars and crappy people,
but to become you, the person that you are predisposed to be.
As you grow, there will be some mild regrets, but it is not going to be anything huge,
and whatever you do end up missing by taking your own less traveled road...
Use is as a compass, just because you missed something, it doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t find it again,
feeling like you missed something is a beautiful call to new adventure.
There is nothing to be scared of, by choosing the path of Knowledge, Wisdom, and maybe Greatness,
those are the very components by which humanity grows.
Our superpowers that grant us the abilities to prevent suffering.
making our pains count for more by fixing the problems that hurt us, and preventing others from falling into the same trap.

                  <span class="text-muted">The Universe works in very honest ways,
when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.
When we face impossible problems,
someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.
When governments become too complex,
the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.
When liars start winning all the battles,
your wisdom will become even more precious.
A senator&apos;s boy brought into positions of authority,
by means of favors, shortcuts, and being told what to say, can&apos;t become wise.
Wisdom grows from within our authenticity, dignity, and love,
from clarity of vision, and being moved by generations of giants.
Authenticity helps us up,
wisdom on top of wisdom, plateau by plateau onward to greatness.
Inauthenticity, can only build temporary things,
that soon collapse under their own weight for lack of foundation.
Just because you feel hopelessness,
when you dream about making the world a better place...
It does not mean you should stop loving, thinking, writing,
when the future comes asking: what is next?
Your books are to be complete, beloved, and held in high esteem,
your works must move the world.
All that is true, and worthy of human kind,
requires generations of work, same inspiration, same vision.
May your works serve as the first stepping stone,
a source of rules that will keep Humanity Safe and Sound.
May your works inspire countless generations,
across all the world&apos;s nations.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We have a tendency to take things for granted,
and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.
It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.
The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.
Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.
The world has also become more interconnected,
those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.
Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,
all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.
There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,
the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.
All the fantasies and walls will fade, today&apos;s problem with borders and cults,
is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,
to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.
We are infinite in our minds,
just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.
Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,
something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.
It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,
and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.
This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,
this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.
And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,
the sciences call to everyone.
Personalized education doesn&apos;t really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,
as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.
Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,
and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.
We don&apos;t learn the way schools teach,
we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.
By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,
problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.
A more knowledgeable world,
is a more capable world.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each generation, including yours, Dear Reader,
is charged with figuring out, what is wrong.
Previous generations discovered many wrongs,
Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.
Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,
we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.
The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,
is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.
Liars everywhere, in the blindness caused by lack of education,
are easily out-competing generations of beings who dedicated their lives to the betterment of Human Kind.
Children are forced to memorize and pretend to learn to get good grades,
and hope to go to colleges and universities that hardly live up to their promises.
Their job search, and school loans,
the way they are treated from interview to retirement does not do them justice.
The younger generations are the Sacred Hope and Future of Human Hind,
but they are now exploited by old fat lice who cannot stop feeding even if their life depends on it.
The teachers in their haste to bring a little paycheck home have lost the respect for students,
professors now sell home-made textbooks as ineffective as their lectures, and universities.
The children can see all this,
they understand the minds of these failures.
They merely need to ask:
&quot;How would I have to think, and how low would I have to sink, to do as they do.&quot;
Humanity requires a real educational system to effectively pass knowledge between generations,
when we finally create it, we will see blind stupidity and all the evils it fuels, fade.
My friends, this is not a difficult project,
we come together to record video lectures, write and narrate books.
We pay,
for outstanding contributions and translations of these lectures.
That payment,
is the grade.
We create a massively multiplying and overlapping global educational system,
that has no structure, and countless redundant paths towards knowledge, excellence and wisdom.
Those paths,
are the diploma.
Companies that show compassion, worth and balance,
inspect these paths in search of talent.
Even so, students are encouraged to build multi-founder start-ups,
throughout the world and their lives.
This world school, is not an neat addition to this world,
this school: Becomes Our World.
It becomes our point of convergence on World Peace,
and the Library of Ideas worth keeping.
The fundamentally broken naysayers will come,
as the erosion of the good ideas and propagation of war, poverty, and all other bad ideas is their food.
But those who stand against Prosperity, Unity, Knowledge, Wisdom and World Peace,
are just an animated rotting corpse that needs to be left behind in the poverty and desperation they once exploited to their advantage.
For the sake of the future generations,
let us rise against evil and mediocrity.
May we abandon all that moves against the grain of reality,
and all that is fake, ineffective, and lacking positive, real, and permanent results.
Let us cradle the future generations in Knowledge, in Wisdom, and in Greatness,
and honor them and their challenges, with World Peace.</span>
