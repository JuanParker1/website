                    <p>It felt so healthy to sit down to the first version,</p>
                    <p>the promise of creating a program that will change the world felt amazing.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They settled on trusty bare bones <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a>,</p>
                    <p>and the first routes they put in were view and edit.</p>

                    <p>Carl Sagan once said, that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,</p>
                    <p>you must first invent the universe.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> the inventor of WikiWiki,
                    <p>has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>With just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,</p>
                    <p>in the most simplest way possible.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,</p>
                    <p>the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,</p>
                    <p>it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,</p>
                    <p>the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,</p>
                    <p>and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,</p>
                    <p>by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,</p>
                    <p>every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,</p>
                    <p>and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,</p>
                    <p>this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,</p>
                    <p>basically a blank Wikipedia.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>So now came the big question,</p>
                    <p>which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,</p>
                    <p>after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,</p>
                    <p>cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>

                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.</p>
                    <p>and they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>Adding user support had to come in next,</p>
                    <p>just like every city had a page, so did every user.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,</p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">Alice and Bob</a>.
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Out in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,</p>
                    <p>and she named the malicious politician Mallory.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Alice and Bob represented computer programs,</p>
                    <p>they were chatbots.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,</p>
                    <p>they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The bots weren&apos;t really inspired by anything other than old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> programs but there was a beautiful line of code,</p>
                    <p>that one of the leads always looked at, <a href="https://github.com/hubotio/hubot-rules/blob/master/src/rules.js#L26">line 26</a> in a sample script of github&apos;s hubot.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>The bots were special,</p>
                    <p>they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>As a whole they already created a very simple,</p>
                    <p>but living simulation.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,</p>
                    <p>the bot actually got its information from Detroit&apos;s own weather service.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,</p>
                    <p>that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,</p>
                    <p>that made working on the system fun.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But by far the most special thing about bots,</p>
                    <p>was that they could be replaced by a real human,</p>
                    <p>by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In the next release of the program,</p>
                    <p>the girls focused on enhancing this feature.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,</p>
                    <p>but when a real person took over for an account,</p>
                    <p>they could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Even in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,</p>
                    <p>that a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>As with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,</p>
                    <p>but it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,</p>
                    <p>and in the end large cities would go online within weeks,</p>
                    <p>because it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.</p>

                    <p>Becoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,</p>
                    <p>it becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.</p>

                    <p>There is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,</p>
                    <p>that contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Any adventure,
is an adventure.
You don&apos;t have to go far,
though walking will be involved.
Adventures within adventures,
are even more fun.
That&apos;s where you go somewhere,
and then explore something else from there.
It is like going to Ludington,
but then marching around Nordhouse Dunes.
Or visiting White Fish Point,
and then trying to find fossils on the beach.
Or even going to the mall with your friends,
and then just people watching instead.
One definition of tiny adventures,
is going somewhere and then learning something new.
But you see, in this modern age we live in now,
this is a lot more exciting than it sounds, because of Audio Books.
Though you maybe walking to the store for a change,
your Audio Book, may transport you to the Appalachian Trail.
There are other things that can spice up your adventures,
it all depends how creative you are.
For example, back in January 2014,
during the gorgeous -16 Fahrenheit Polar Vortex weather in Michigan.
With all the warnings as not to go outside,
and stay home, and drink hot chocolate.
I put on all my clothes, all at once,
and hurried out, for an hour-and-a-half-long expedition.
I wasn&apos;t in want for anything,
so I figured I might as well get some little beef jerky sausages.
It didn&apos;t seem as cold as everyone made it out to be,
but it did make my sausages; as frosty, as my little adventure fantastic.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Time for all of us to rise,
to fuel that which is greatest within us.
It is how we change the world with our works,
that matters the most in the end.
It is almost certainly a very small book,
one that will sit along side a smartphone.
And it is a book of answers,
that helps the children to real life.
Let us open our books
by undoing burdens:
&quot;Whatever trouble brought you to my book, child,
know that there are few people
that would have acted differently
in circumstances similar to yours.&quot;
And then carefully, let us share,
in the limited number of pages that we have,
what has moved us the most.
Without our hard earned wisdom,
they don&apos;t really have a chance at not making the same mistakes.
Who else is going to teach them if not us,
what Socrates said was only meant for the age he grew up in.
We need to repeat it anew,
nearer the culture of the children.
We have to help them understand,
that old age is a privileged denied to many.
So as long as we take to living in pursuit if wisdom,
and it is never to late to start, aging is a good thing.
Let us not have the children start at the same height we stated,
let us spare them the aches we went through, may our aches count for more.
Let us show the younger generations that we are rising,
that we are building a better world albeit slowly.
The world can&apos;t be replaced,
it must be transformed.
Just like a ship can&apos;t be replaced,
but can be transformed by updating it, board by board.
Let us show them that part of the meaning of their existence,
is a lasting legacy of wisdom.
The sooner they start,
the more beautiful their rise.
And the other part is Happiness,
out of Wisdom, out of Strength.
The meaning of life comes with Wisdom,
as our mind becomes more powerful for all the good ideas it gathers.
We have to help the children to understand,
that they belong to a Universal Culture, that they are Citizens of the World.
That all the things that change based on geographic location,
are but traditions.
Only that which remains regardless of where they are born,
is their true culture.
We have to get them to help each other as they grow,
to reach out to each other across borders.
The borders that dive us,
borders are just the products of small and primitive minds.
The future belongs to the children,
not those who gained authority by pretending.
There is hope for a more just and transparent world,
but it requires that we all stand in relentless pursuit of wisdom.
A liar will always win,
except when it comes to the wise
The wise will easily recognize the uneducated fool,
taking on his pleasing shapes.
Let us help the younger generations, to wisdom,
by telling them about Philosophers and their Love and Pursuit of Wisdom.
Let us pass on only the good ideas,
and commit the bad ones to history books as cautionary tales.
A life is a work of art, it paints it self day by day,
to create a beautiful picture, our legacy.
Life is best lived when what we learned yesterday,
adds to help us become a little bit wiser today.
The energy and the force for it all comes from
from watching our contributions help the world grow.
The new generations starting, not at zero,
but at the heights that we bought them to, by our own deliberate pursuit of wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">A hole in the window curtain,
lets a stray ray of light in.
The light displays a blurry image,
of what is outside, a pin hole camera.
As the beam travels along the wall,
he can imagine the entire solar system.
He knows the planet spins and rotates,
by inference from Jupiter Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
And now slowly the light,
reaches an old crystal vase.
There is a rainbow,
the beam of light is unfurled.
He&apos;s counting the colors,
and a violin plays.
And A becomes Blue,
B is Indigo,
C turns Violet,
D is Red,
E becomes Orange,
F is Yellow,
and G glows Green.
He watched the whole thing,
in bed, in silence.
He knows now he will turn led to gold,
let the Clockwork Universe, Unfold.
You are so lucky that you live in an age where you can pull up,
Newton&apos;s book on opticks with the click of a link.
In most cases you can&apos;t be stopped by by research you have not yet conducted,
and you don&apos;t have to invent much from scratch, you just need a science book.
You have the same mental powers as Newton and all the others,
but you DO, have to slow down, and think about things just like they did.
Learning or catching up,
is an Art.
Even though you have all the answers before you,
you can&apos;t read it all at once.
You have to follow one thread at a time,
our minds need time to comprehend and rearrange.
Like the body of a dancer needs time to adapt,
we have to learn at a precise pace, and sequence.
It is very similar to learning the roads of a new city,
you never say to your self I am not smart enough to navigate.
Because you never listen to confusing directions,
you just follow a single road at your own pace and eventually master it.
See, Newton learned from works of Galileo,
who passed away the year Newton was born.
And although Newton never did convert led to gold,
the led of his pencil, became even more precious.
Many of Newton&apos;s works,
must have fascinated Henry Cavendish.
And Einstein no doubt appreciated the modes of thinking these men revealed,
even though he never figured out his Spooky Action at a Distance.
They all learned much along the way,
and each became wise for trying.

                  <span class="text-muted">It is quite a quirk we have,
that we believe whatever we are born into.
It is such a terrible disadvantage,
and nobody, makes it known to us.
The study of Cognitive Biases,
should be first and foremost.
I wish teachers would speak out more often,
instead they are just pushing everyone through.
For one they get to keep their jobs,
and two, it is not their job to fix education.
It takes so little, to start learning on your own,
and it makes such an enormous difference.
Life becomes so long, and so cheerful,
and you can feel your self growing up.
Book by book, curiosity by curiosity,
all the dots connect.
And they will only connect,
if you are learning what you like or love.
If someone is making those selections for you,
then it is all just going to be disconnected noise.
At a young age it is all to easy to say,
education is not for me.
Similar thing happens in Academic Philosophy,
people simply say &quot;Philosophy is useless for life&quot;.
&quot;Academic Philosophy,
has no relevance.&quot;
Philo-sophia means Love of Wisdom,
but when it it taken into Academia...
When it is divided into subjects,
it loses everything, it becomes synthetic, and useless.
That&apos;s how you should view Education divided into subjects,
synthetic, and useless.
Real education is the thing that Great Beings granted themselves,
before standardized schooling became mandatory and cut up.
Build your own school,
book by book, adventure by adventure, curiosity by curiosity.
You have a powerful mind,
the constellation of stars within, is perfectly unique.
You are irreplaceable,
in every way.
Don&apos;t trust anybody to teach you anything,
just make your way towards books that move you.
In this modern age,
books are read to you, by professional narrators.
So as long as you slow down to give them a chance, you can learn,
from the Proudest Works, of the Greatest Minds, in the best of ways.
Teachers only care about the moment they are in,
but your life, will be long.
Your life will carry on,
long after school.
You need real education,
one that leads to real wisdom.
We can&apos;t go through life,
filled with disconnected knowledge that can&apos;t connect.
We need a self-reinforcing, integrated library,
of all the modern works.
You can only get that from modern non-fiction, or popular science books,
and especially when authors reference or thank each other.
A popular science book is a story about the science,
about the things that made it come into being.
Facts are the least that thy take away from it,
it is the stories of adventure, and modes of thinking that matter most.
Our search for wisdom must come first,
or we won&apos;t be able to tell real from fake.
Wisdom is fundamental to our decision making,
clarity of vision, is too important to trust others with.
It shouldn&apos;t matter where to to whom we are born,
there is just one reality.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each day always starts with getting up,
except that, in the little wilderness you can&apos;t just roll out of bed.
At first, at best, you roll over,
to see where everything is at.
And although you can kind of lift yourself,
you can&apos;t really get up.
You sleep on the ground,
in a little tent.
That means you can,
only! stretch one limb at a time, and only a bit.
A successful decoupling and release,
requires great gymnastics.
The first order of the day,
is always fire, and a food item if you got one.
The trick to starting a fire,
is to start with tiny twigs that matches can light.
And then you add bigger, and bigger sticks,
it is absolutely required that you do a little dance.
The second order of the day, is adventure,
so you set off immediately.
Bring a day pack a water bottle,
if you are not sure where you are headed, follow the seagulls.
In my case there is this fantastic out of place bench,
right a top a dune.
One of the odd things about it is that,
it is about a foot too high off the ground, due to dune erosion.
To get atop of it, you must hoist a knee, and then kind of desperately roll in to it,
with an intense expression, and you realize that you haven&apos;t done that since your terrible twos.
Upon basking in the sun, the next order in the day,
is troublemaking.
On that particular day, I&apos;ve noticed two weary travelers by the parking lot,
sniffing the leaves of a tree, that they were eagerly attempting to identify.
I briskly walked up to them and said,
&quot;Oh my god, you guys, this is poison ivy, don&apos;t touch that.&quot;
One of the older ladies started making chicken noises at her friend,
and I waddled away.
To, my surprise, I discovered that this parking lot held a water pump,
I had no idea.
The fourth order of the day,
is the venerable search for a walking stick to continue the walk about.
This is no easy mater at Nordhouse as you can&apos;t miss the:
&quot;THIS IS BEAR COUNTY&quot; posters printed in Bold Comic Sans all over.
Any venture into the woods could potentially result in a dangerous standoff,
between a snarling man and a beast.
The fifth order of the day, at least for me,
is fossil hunting.
I have my collection right next to me as I write this,
though they all look like gibberish to me, some of those thing are prehistoric.
Fantastic!
It is a long walk to my favorite spot,
but it looks like a dune valley where you are surrounded by pretty tall dunes.
And here I cheerfully waddle back,
with a pocket full of rocks.
Back to my camp,
eyes still searching for fossils.
In the early afternoon it is good time to set off for the gas station,
here I usually grab a sausage and a couple of gallons of water, maybe a candy bar.
And the day slowly nears getting some more firewood,
sharpening a stick for the sausage, and waiting for the sunset to come.
At Twilight I prepare my Audio Book for the evening,
and crawl back into my fluffy sleeping bag.
