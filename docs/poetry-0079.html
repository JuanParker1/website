                  <span class="text-muted">Living is Art,
so lift your brush to the canvas, Dear Friends.
Fatigue, overwork, imbalance, tiredness,
all conspire to keep us running in circles.
Especially, right before setting off on an adventure,
sometimes it takes up to a week, to remember who we are.
First couple of days, are the worst,
it feels like adventure is not worth it, and we need to go back.
Back to what?
And how many years has it been now?
Adventure is a cute upside-down word,
hoping to remind you that you are full of energy and sunshine.
That you are a professional troublemaker,
and a fancy bookworm.
As good as your poker face is, under stress,
Ohh, the sh*tstorm that you will sow and reap, with your beautiful and perfect deadpan comedy,
upon an unsuspecting fellow shopper, whilst waiting in the checkout line at the local Supermarket.
They won&apos;t *ever* know what hit them, and you will uncontrollably giggle all the way back to your car,
whilst crunching the ice cream with sprinkles you just bought, with a whole new level of joy.
Nevermind, that for the first time in your life you own a phat marker,
and you started tagging the toilets with your incredible and edgy wit.
You&apos;ll get it under control,
I know you will.
There is just a couple of little problems that we do need to talk about...
(and this does not apply to all, just a couple of my readers)
Firstly, stop answering kind greetings &quot;Oh, hey, how are you?&quot; with,
&quot;Still Here&quot; - honestly, we know, we&apos;ve noticed, we just want to known how you are doing this?
And then telling people that you are, or used to be, or whatever: a Firefighter - must stop,
honestly, most people already assumed - that you used you volunteer - to put out hot fires.
Your multiple fanny packs, that&apos;s on point, everybody knows that all the great superheroes,
from Dwayne The Rock Goddamn Johnson to Tomb Raider and Freaky Batman, root and toot for you.
Now, this poem would be incomplete if I didn&apos;t ask you to get up right now,
and stretch a leg or two, a bit, and lookup Nurnberg Trailhead at W Nurnberg Rd, Free Soil, MI 49411.
Or any other tiny Wilderness that&apos;s not too near, not too far,
and spend the afternoon picking out a backpack, a fancy little tent...
The fluffiest sleeping bag you can find,
and one of those fancy inflatable pillows that will make you pass right out.
Grab a box of matches, the biggest, baddest Overkill Rambo knife you can find,
a water bottle, peanut butter wonder bread, a confusing compass and a load of sausages.
And go, don&apos;t delay, if the northern hemisphere is cold,
head on south, if south is cranky, head on north.
You are not supposed live to work,
you are only supposed to work just enough, to live so that you can Read and Listen to Books, and Grow.
Every day is the first day of the rest of your life,
and young or old, every day is a beautiful gift.
And there is no such thing as old age,
that&apos;s just a boogie man that the cowards made up
(If they can&apos;t become a great adventurer, why should anybody else)
Old age is a privilege, denied to many.
People that care about you want you to be Healthy, and Mighty,
they want you to be an Inspiration, that will forever inspire them to, Greatness.
Do not let a day go by...
And gol dang it, you&apos;re a Warrior.
Get two Rambo knives, the one on the left for sausages.
The one on the right, for throwing...
and for chopping Wood, and Moose, and Beaver
- that are so foolish as to wonder into your beautiful campsite.
Eat them,
or Curse Them!
But whatever you do,
get moving right now.
Due north, due south,
whichever is more welcoming.
Go.
Gooooolly, Go.

                  <span class="text-muted">Schools and Teachers, Universities, Colleges, and Professors, and even Politicians,
all had an amazing opportunity to enable the current generations with Real Education.
They will keep saying that they are working on it, and that they love students,
but then they will get confused and put politics first, creating that Hollow Feeling again.
You know what, they have ran out of time,
this is a big century for Human Kind.
We started out on the wrong foot,
we doubled the total of fossil fuel emissions in the last 25 years.
When Al Gore was working on his book,
he was writing in a world that had half the atmospheric emission we do.
You see, we are the leaders now, the intellectuals, the poets, the artists,
the people who failed to stop that doubling have retired or passed away.
If we were to ask them what they did it,
they could only say &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;
No blame, no accountability,
the change is so slow that the men who were destroying the world are gone.
The next 80 years is really important,
we can&apos;t afford to test if perhaps fake education will work out for us if we cram.
It maybe time, to temporarily push away from the promise of a diploma and a job,
and catch up with what has been going on in the world.
Reading and listening to real books is important,
taking responsibility for our own education, is very important.
You get to pick your Audio Books, your own Lecture Videos,
watch Documentaries about Climate and Nature, maybe Politics.
Keep a journal, do a book review,
for every Audio Book and Documentary you like.
And get out there, go camping, and adventuring.
Maybe even section hike the Appalachian Trail, or the Pacific Crest Trail,
or El Camino de Santiago and Kom-Emine, with your friends and parents.
Let the sunrise tell you when it is time to study,
let the sunset help you to sleep.
A lot that was lost in translation during standardized education,
can be pretty quickly regained, with top non-fiction, as long as you make room for it.
So, let us consider taking a year off when we feel ready for books,
maybe before college, or before we transfer to a university.
The journal and corresponding hiking videos or book reviews,
will provide plenty of evidence that it was not a year that was merely lost.
It seems that our Elder Selves will not hold falling in love with books against us,
to the contrary, this maybe one of those things that they wish for.

                  <span class="text-muted">Humanity is like a Garden,
and Humans are flowers that grow with Knowledge.
No one flower can make the other grow,
but we can share and pass on good ideas amongst each other.
All those good ideas combined,
form our body of Knowledge.
Only with real knowledge,
can we bloom in Wisdom.
A Blooming Garden,
is a Higher Power.
To help Humanity grow,
free and mandatory education was invented.
Our level of knowledge rose,
and it rose high enough for us to want more.
The original schools in their zeal to process everyone,
are attempting to confine the garden withing its small walls.
The schools are a simple and dumb machine,
aim to produce the same bunch of flowers.
New, smart technology, has emerged,
and we are now able to Listen to Books and Pick our own Lectures.
And we must do so,
and as quickly as possible.
Let us then choose a small and interesting adventure,
and in the perfect sequence, and at just the right pace.
Begin our study of what we like,
and not what somebody else wants us to like.
The flowers need Real Knowledge to Bloom,
and real knowledge can only be gained and sustained by what we enjoy.
Each flower leans towards a unique constellation of starts,
there is nothing that can be standardized about Real Education.
Standardized Education can only destroy spirit and creativity,
exhaust us, spark by irreplaceable spark, and without ever lighting the flame.
As soon as you feel that school is holding you back,
read your own books, watch your own documentaries and lectures.
Real education, is your own education,
one that you will care for and nurture with passion and joy throughout your entire existence.
Personal Note,
It may feel silly at first,
when you finally take your first baby steps towards something you like.
But that is just a beginning,
they are always very little.
The beautiful thing about it,
is that your first step, will be quickly followed by your second one.
For example,
You may take to watercolors,
and it will all come out a crooked doodle.
But that does not mean that it is over,
or that you are not a genius.
It means you need to buy,
a $100 Video Projector.
Take a selfie,
project it on your watercolor paper.
Use a pencil to mark where colors go,
and now you can paint anew.
Oh, and by the way, to lower color saturation,
mix it with the color opposite, on the color wheel.
Now armed with those two baby steps,
ask your heart, where to go next?
Posters, Murals, Pixel Art,
and if you are unsure, then take a break...
and design and write a small art book about finding a good projector,
and selecting just the right paints, so that you may deeply reflect n what moves you.
Everything comes with a sweet and beautiful little road like this,
we are all human, and what we achieve, we achieve with our hearts.
One of the reasons why many of the wonders that we admire today, exist,
is because someone found a pleasant path to get there a baby step at a time.
Now it might have taken them ten years of baby steps to get there,
but since it was what they loved, they didn&apos;t even think of it as a challenge.
When we follow the path that enriches us,
high achievement becomes indistinguishable from growing up.
Later on in life,
as we face new challenges.
It will be our sweet little pursuits and lessons,
that will offer us the answers we need.
And do so by subtle and beautiful analogy,
to the little problems that we solved in our happy pursuits of yesteryear.</span>

is all there is, and it is all that will hold the world together.
From the little seed of your notebook, your trusty pencil,
that one thing you posted on the internet that still impresses you,
grows a Brilliant Thinker.
A Custodian of Knowledge, A Lover of Wisdom,
and a Great Being.
If you choose to practice resignation, if you fall,
the link of chain that holds the past and the future of Humanity will weaken.
The many Hearts, of The Great Beings that rose before you,
will wail and howl, and the universe will become permanently darker for it.
School is just the best all of the uneducated humanity at the time could agree on,
it is our first best try, and it was a failure that in its misery will now serve us,
as a source of wisdom for building the second generation of schools.
This time everybody can see, that proper education is the best hope humanity has,
this time we will know the price that an Miseducated Earth pays.
People that made you feel unintelligent, made a mistake out of desperation,
because they couldn&apos;t have know how to teach, because the idea of the classroom,
and standardized education and testing is just an uninformed political fantasy,
crafted for simple and convincing displays of progress, and easy reelection campaigns.
School was invented as an experiment by Great Self Taught Beings,
though it is broken, it still serves to keep the Global Level of Knowledge high enough,
for us to communicate about leaving bad ideas behind, and which are worth keeping.
We know it will be based on the way the Self Taught learn,
we know there will be no grades, just your brilliant path through the tree of knowledge.
The new generation of schools will bring Humanity closer together,
it will help us take better care of our Planet and its Inhabitants.
We used to think that school was an island,
but it turned out to be the very thing that steers humanity forward in time.
You were seen as students once,
and now you will be seen as Earth&apos;s Captains,
Lighthouse Keepers, Navigators, and Admirals.
If I may,
Let us begin by taking to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
and setting it as the Opening Chapter of the New Text Book,
in recognition that school is directly responsible,
for the future of Earth and all her Inhabitants.
May the first lesson, of this first New Text Book,
stand to describe how vulnerable we are to cultural indoctrination,
and the resulting following without thinking.
May it serve as a cautionary tale,
and as an inspiration to Leadership, clear thinking,
and always choosing the harder right over the easier wrong.
May all the countless chapters of this new book help each student,
young or old to find their beginning and discover their unique path through Human Knowledge.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each human being contains precisely one labyrinth mostly consisting of a single long winding road with plenty of forks.
this is their own perfect, private, personal, sacred curriculum.
If they are granted the opportunity to follow it,
at their own pace, in their own way, they will eventually become Wise.
This wondrous road, must double as a library,
and it can only contain Humanity&apos;s Noblest Works of Knowledge and Wisdom.
The men who created, and rebuilt, and mixed up, and reformed the standardized education curricula,
are politicians, bureaucrats, and fake it until you make artists with something but temporary to prove.
Most had agendas, made trades, deals, promises,
some worked to compress one part, while others added more garbage to the next.
Unlike a road, there is no path that leads up the Tree of Knowledge here,
the standardized curriculum is a patchwork of political fantasies.
It shows a complete misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
and great emphasis on easy administration of tests that only an uneducated voter would see any value in.
Our path of exploration,
is sacred.
You are unique,
you cannot be replaced.
There are no actors,
that could pretend to be you.
And you are a key,
a key to a higher understanding of the Universe and Human Condition.
No one can interrupt your quest for wisdom,
and you should never suspend it or give up.
That beautiful road of questions and answers,
forks, and diverging paths that lead you up.
Up to the very top of the Tree of Knowledge,
to grow up, and move Mountains, and become a Great Being.
That beautiful road and mountains beyond hold the answers,
that the world needs in other to Grow, and Heal, and Mature.
Your life may seem ordinary,
but it is not.
The universe is always gasping for more brilliance,
and when the roads are denied or not taken, it grows darker for it.
Even your sadness,
makes the universe darker.
The world needs you to grow,
it needs our brilliance to become an Enlightened, Wise and Peaceful Place.
It just so happens that we have tiny flaw,
we accept authority, and believe the culture we are born into.
In a world where schools follow a curriculum that is a patchwork,
of political promises, and lowest common denominator garbage meant to easily test progress.
We fall in to the rabbit hole,
we become indoctrinated into the belief that education is not our own path,
But a hodge-podge of trinkets,
that we must toil and moil to unpack to try to make some sense of.
It is possible to follow your own path,
and then come back to school and come out with a perfect grade.
But doing this also adds legitimacy to a very sick system,
that removes people natural predisposition for beauty to replace it with a mere impression of knowledge.
Many will wholly reject the fact that schools are broken,
because it is all they knew.
Heartbreakingly, they will hold up a beautiful book by a beloved Science Popularizer,
and laugh at how it left out at all the things that they have memorized in class.
But Knowledge is not about recalling all the facts,
be it by memorization or mnemonic.
Knowledge, is about synthesizing new observations, new ideas, new challenges,
from magnificent conjecture to newly discovered brilliant theories, formulas, facts, and inventions.
And, not at some abstract point, post graduation which after all a mere piece of paper,
but the genesis of new ideas from the moment you finish reading your fifth book on a subject you like.
The way you progress through your labyrinth of discovery, and that path through the tree of knowledge, is baby step at a time,
sometimes you&apos;ll discover something that will take you left, sometimes right, but you will always move upwards, always growing up.
Your path must be a sequence of steps that make sense to you,
pleasant answers to your curiosities.
Your path is deeply personal,
it helps your mind to grow Strong and Healthy.
Standardized education, is so mixed up that it is best memorized,
but memorization can only be temporary, it is not helpful in ideas synthesis, it is only helpful for actors and pretenders.
Schools are a recent invention, and it was a lot worse before, but now we need more,
a clearer, more personalized, more honest, more loving schools, that help to guide people towards Wisdom and Knowledge.
But to achieve that dream, we must take responsibility for our own education first,
only then will we know how to build the next generation of schools.</span>
