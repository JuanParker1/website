examine life in search for wisdom.
When someone pulls you,
stand your ground.
When someone frightens you,
leave.
You will find no answers,
except, for one place.
Call it the Library,
Books, Video Lectures, or Audio Books.
The only people that deliver Components of Wisdom,
are the authors of top selling non-fiction.
Schools and Nations,
are overwhelmed.
Clogged with uneducated pretenders,
incapable of vision.
They proclaim World Peace,
to be stupid.
And parade Mutually Assured Destruction,
instead.
Grow strong and free,
and learn to no end.
Nobody is coming,
to deliver wisdom unto you.
You!
have to go get the books yourself.
Do not wait,
your knowledge dictates all your decisions.
There are too many liars,
too much mediocrity.
Too much hidden in plain sight,
beneath a shroud of inaction.
The quest for World Peace,
is in your hands now.
The Great Search for Wisdom and Greatness,
awaits you.
Please,
do not delay.
For you are meant to become
a Great Being.
You are to lead the change,
the little ones will soon hope for.
In an incomplete world,
we can&apos;t rest.
Rise for Education, Truth, Peace,
Equality, Freedom and Justice.
The future now begs that all children
are taught to become Great Beings.
May the World grow,
with Knowledge, Love, Wisdom, and Foresight.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">The educational shortcut,
is always a lie.
The only thing we will find in a shortcut,
is a fantasy or fairy tale, an impression of education, or make-believe success.
There is really no need to take shortcuts in life,
learning and growing up is beautiful.
Growing up, is an act of endless tiny adventures,
as you pursue your little curiosities onward to wisdom.
Most adventures are very poetic, adventures in spirit so to speak,
such as learning to paint low-brow art with oil on canvas, whilst listening to Kenji Kawai.
Many adventures are actual expeditions that involve backpacks and sometimes even tents,
it still counts, when you only camp in your backyard; an adventure is an adventure.
The more advanced art of listening to audio books when hiking through a little wilderness,
is so pleasant, so relaxing and educational that no one should want to skip it.
When books are read to us,
we really connect with what the author is saying.
Reading books with our own inner-voice, is not perfect because we bring in our own worries and tone,
the book is always tethered down with what is going on in our life and what comes tomorrow.
Books are stories that must be told with passion,
and by an external voice, with some approval from the author; if not the author her self.
It is not possible to walk through the woods, and sticks and roots,
and read a book in such a way that we can hear the author try to teach us wisdom.
Yes, it is important that we walk through green valleys and fragrant woodlands,
it is not the same to listen to a book in the busy streets of a city full of strangers.
Nature has a very powerful impact on us,
it makes us slow down, it makes us calmer, we sleep at sunset and awake at sun rise.
Without fears, distractions, and the hurry of the busy life,
books begin fitting into our lifestyle as our heart begins to call for wisdom.
Nature and Books are opposite of shortcuts, they
create very long and wise lives.
This is a lifestyle of learning and growing up,
it cannot hurt us, it can only make us better, and it will spare us mistakes.
In this kind of life,
no one will push you to hurry up.
No one will frighten you, or lie to you,
here you just cheerfully move at your own speed.
Always thinking,
and always learning, always growing up.
In the life that we are all expected to live,
people lie when they say college will grant you a successful career.
Only you can guarantee yourself a successful career,
and you have to start very early, maybe as early as middle-school.
You have to begin thinking about co-founding a series of tiny companies
that will help you learn about business, and what it means to be a leader, a founder, and a CEO.
You have to discover and follow your passions,
and further your inventions.
Real investors don&apos;t care much for a sales pitch with an elevator cartoon,
they look for genius, passion, sanity, and long therm visions.
On the other hand working for somebody else under several management layers,
does not guarantee a healthy career.
We maybe forced into stress, overwork,
and have all our balance drained from us.
Just because we can work at a breakneck speed,
it does not mean that we should, that kind of lifestyle is very dangerous.
Servitude of this kind will make us age faster,
long after the bosses tried to tell us &quot;life is not fair&quot; we will still suffer from effects of overwork.
We must keep a healthy balance with day and night and nature,
we are not machines, we are poetry.
There are no shortcuts,
and learning is beautiful.
For one you never stop learning, and two; life never stops challenging you,
and three, you must live healthy.
Take good care of your self,
it is the lifetimes of wisdom you inherit from all the books that make the biggest difference.
Life is meant to be lived beautifully and cheerfully;
consciousness is such an impossible gift from the Universe, that without a doubt, you are meant to be happy.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Knowledge has an enormous impact on decision making,
if you don&apos;t know enough you maybe taken advantage of.
You gain knowledge by means of authentic education,
an education that has maximum impact on your existence.
Memorization or cramming is not an authentic education,
it is not any kind of education.
You don&apos;t want to rely on a doctor that memorized everything in school,
professionals must look things up to keep up with changes.
Memorization is only good for two things,
passing tests, and getting you ready for a factory job on an assembly line.
And on the other end, tests are for teachers to keep their jobs,
and principals to keep getting funding.
You have to make sure that you are not getting sold for a money,
that you are not being used to sustain an outdated industry.
And above all, do not let them trick you into thinking yo are not smart,
we are all extremely smart, we are all, without exception extremely good at learning for real.
The problem is with schools, they are trying to use a single teacher,
to teach anywhere between 30 and 300 students.
There is no way that a teacher can handle that,
so they will make up tests so that majority passes and damn the rest.
Memorization is just a temporary circus trick,
make sure you are learning meaningful things that have lasting impact.
Real education will multiply you,
fake education will make a fool out of you.
Decision-making is one of the most important things in life,
we need Real Education, Real Knowledge to help us make correct decisions in life.
Many of the decisions we make early on,
have long term impact that continues for decades in not for life.
It also matters that we grow up in an authentic culture,
if we are surrounded by lairs that too will contribute to push us off the path we want to be on.
You must ask if perhaps the school industry is using outdated teaching methods
that barely worked during industrial revolution, to keep getting government money.
Every student in every country,
from middle school to university must to check if they are really learning for real.
Real education is one that enriches a person with Knowledge gained in previous generations,
real education provides many lifetimes of knowledge in a beautifully arranged bouquet.
In turn, that Knowledge grows in you as its components become your own building blocks,
and help you to become Strong, Happy, Wise, Beautiful,
and eventually help you become a Great Being, one who makes lasting contributions to Human Kind.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Real Education, makes you, more you,
it greatly enhances your all predispositions.
No one has the right to hold you in contempt for your talents,
no one has the right to tell you who you should become.
All pursuits of excellence lead to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,
the longer it takes the more precious the result.
Ignore the so called teachers that will try to control you, or sway you off your path,
their only wish is to make their own lives easier even if it means sacrificing who you are.
Real education is somehow completely misunderstood,
and people do end up getting lost in life.
For example, some may enjoy a single subject,
and fall behind on all the rest.
Then, to fix their grades,
they are made to focus on fixing subjects that they are bad at.
In the process they interrupt themselves,
they are made to interfere with their own, more-real education.
And, here the beneficiary is the teacher and the dean,
and the reward is eventual raises for keeping GPAs stable.
Long after these frauds are gone,
their victims suffer, never having found a comfortable place.
Sometimes, even after the fools are gone people continue feeling guilt for their talents,
they become convinced that doodles are dumb, and poems are stupid.
It is hard to find happiness in doing things that we don&apos;t care about,
it maybe impossible even.
A life void of happiness,
is a life of depression and constant anxiety.
Even the smallest of our predispositions will develop into unique greatness,
a greatness that is hard to see at first, hard to reason about.
Let me make this clear, Real Education is not about getting a job,
it is about becoming a Great Being, who has much more to add.
And some people,
are a little bit ahead of their time.
For example kids that like to fly drones,
may never fully get into it, unless...
they get access to drones equipped with cameras,
that they can steer through a VR helmet, as if they were piloting them.
If they stick with it,
they will enter electronics, mathematics and software development.
If they get bored, or can&apos;t afford the hardware,
then they will lose something of themselves.
Rule of thumb here,
is to take a predisposition all the way, at all cost.
Hobbies or silly interests are gateways into sciences,
and should always be honored and seen as something very special.
One massive problem is the teachers and parents,
who when lacking similar predispositions will tend to destroy talent.
And they do it because they don&apos;t want their kid to stick out,
they don&apos;t need the extras and the questions that come along with them.
They may say that games are for children,
and talents are useless.
They will say such things because they can&apos;t handle life,
as someone took their talent away and now everything is cumbersome and more than they bargain for.
Coupled with organized and standardized schooling
that divide subjects into meaninglessness and noise that can only be memorized.
Sprinkle in some bullies,
that hate kids that stick out.
All that on top of already bad grades,
as the student may not even be aware that everyone is just memorizing.
And much is lost,
and most permanently.
Real Education is a source of joy, strength,
and contributes to love of life.
The effects of real education
are hard to describe.
It is the different between a pop star, and a girl forced to repeat the semester because she used to like music.
It is the difference between,
a quickly forgotten politician and a famous philosopher that continues to inspire generations.
Between a writer that dabbles in forgettable romance novels,
and one that helps us to understand a strange world of tyranny without tyrants one that we must reject.
Real education creates beings that change lives,
their Works come out of Greatness, nobly fueled by Wisdom and Knowledge.
To deny the becoming of a Great Being is to deny Growing Up,
it means to deny joy, happiness, and love of life.
Everyone is acting as if Greatness and Great Wisdom is rare,
all the while they are stopping each other from a Real Education.
It is Real Education that brings people into areas of Knowledge that they are predisposed to further,
granting them Wisdom, and eventually Greatness.
People who conspire against talent,
are Guidance Counselors, Teachers, and Parents, precisely those who are meant to encourage it.
We must honor the talents and predispositions of the younger generations,
by building personalized educational systems that lead them to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
We must remove all barriers that stand in their way,
the future of the world is in their hands.

                  <span class="text-muted">Just because the world is being tardy,
it does not mean you should be too.
In deed, if you fail to slowly make haste,
then the world will become darker for it.
Every Human must shine,
with Enlightenment.
I know it is hard to accept
that schools may not be working.
We all have so little,
and now even more even rugs are pulled from beneath our feet.
There is other stuff too,
from bad parenting to mutually assured destruction.
I am sorry, if you are looking for answers,
the best answers any of them will ever give you is: &quot;How were we supposed to know?&quot;
A solid foundation in reality is a good start in life,
sometimes we don&apos;t figure things out until it is too late.
I know this poem caught you early,
you have a long time to ponder all this.
And that too is a good start,
a proper Gentlelady or Gentleman questions everything, and takes nothing for granted.
I hope you are still in Middle School or High School,
and you get to walk to your desk, with a heavy step.
Slouch, perk up your ears like a Lion,
and take the whole situation apart.
The kids in the back figured it out already,
but that is as far as they got, they need more answers.
They need you!
the leader.
Maybe you can try thinking about debates,
learning from the way Great Beings argue the pretenders or the uneducated.
You are already given reasons,
now you need to find the truth.
It is never too early,
to begin to question everything.
One of the smallest arguments we are given, is the argument for mathematics,
well, it used to be given, it was that we aren&apos;t always going to have a calculator on hand.
Though it is cute to say that we have smart phones with calculators that have advanced mode,
there is a darker side to it.
Mathematics is not enough,
we need Programming, and we need to be Shell Literate as well.
Vapid and Insipid Mathematics poisoned the beauty of Science,
memorization of formulas obscured the simpler beauty beneath.
Memorization is another problem,
look how carefully you are nudged to abandon reason and understanding in favor of memorization.
The guillotine of failing a class because you tried to learn everything,
instead of passing with a straight A+ for merely cramming for the test - DOES chop your head off.
Look how proud your teacher is, that disingenuous show of teeth,
up for another raise, sold you for a paycheck and on some simple memes that you can get from a calendar.
One of the biggest reasons given to you,
is that you need a Diploma to get a Job.
I would like you to consider, that perhaps a real diploma,
is one that a University goes out of their way to give; you for your Great Achievements.
The diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,
while it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...
...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,
the best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.
Your life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,
there is no Life Arithmetic.
The closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:
Each life is more important than the other.
If someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,
you quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.
If the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,
then you are going to need to try harder.
In case you are wondering,
- I care, and you can&apos;t undo that.
The harder, or the less worn path,
is that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.
And you are not going to be the first or only one,
find the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.
So when someone says &quot;Diploma&quot;,
you reply; &quot;Check Your Premise&quot;, to quote an old friend.
When they say calculator,
you say: &quot;Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.&quot;
When they box you in to memorize,
you get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.
While governments are smart enough to encourage learning,
as evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.
I suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,
in that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.
But you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,
a government can&apos;t easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.
The way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,
is to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.
Self education is not that outrageous,
that is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.
And let me underline that interference will destroy self education,
grades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.
Self education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,
and instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.
Finally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but &quot;Free College&quot; is not quite right,
it should be &quot;Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results&quot;
Compare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don&apos;t need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,
we need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.
You should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,
a good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.
The thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,
as that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.
All you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,
and a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.
And then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,
find a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...
You will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16&quot; Bowie knife (don&apos;t do 14&quot;), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...
and a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.
As you read more and more,
and things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.
Bring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,
one with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.
Later on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,
fool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.
Though I highly recommend section hiking at first,
and also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.
You know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,
and that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.
And that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,
you do graduate ever higher.
I think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height
- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.</span>
