          <p>I took a little nap,<br>
            As I had to finish a website and an app.</p>
          <p>I woke up feeling sweet and mighty and very strong.<br>
            even though I really didn&apos;t sleep for very long.</p>
          <p>Now I have to get ready to go back to real sleep,<br>
            and I hope I don&apos;t end up having to count sheep.</p><br>
          <p>I&apos;ve been learning programming and design all on my own,<br>
            my software is really good now, I have progressed and grown.</p><br>
          <p>There are no shortcuts to becoming really good,<br>
            there is no school that can teach us as they should.</p>
          <p>Talking matters in your own hands is the best way,<br>
            the difference is like night and day.</p>
          <p>For decades I&apos;ve telling people,<br>
            our mind are really, really, really delicate and extremely intricate.</p><br>
          <p>Wherever possible we have to take to the books,<br>
            go on tiny adventures and explore all the crannies and nooks.</p>
          <p>To start learning well, find something pretty,<br>
            real education is like exploring a new city.</p>
          <p>You don&apos;t start by memorizing a map,<br>
            you just go from one place to another, until you need a nap.</p><br>
          <p>The teacher has no idea who you are or what you know,<br>
            if you&apos;ll listen to them you&apos;ll never grow.</p>
          <p>Organized education is like a trap,<br>
            learn on your own, and don&apos;t forget to take a nap.</p>
