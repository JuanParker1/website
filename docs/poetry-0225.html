                  <span class="text-muted">Humanity can only grow by looking into its heart,
and slowly learning Philosophy, Sciences, and Art.
It is easy.
It is what the modern non-fiction is all about,
just, grab an audio book and go all out.
Hey, you don&apos;t need any reasons,
to become a connoisseur of the Seasons!
In Autumn, only read about Mother Nature,
and modern Adventure.
In Winter, focus on Philosophy and Art,
so that come spring you are always chipper and smart.
In Spring, you must absolutely read about Inner Strength,
mostly memoirs just to see how a human can go to great length.
In Summer, read or listen about our History,
how countless great beings fought for Unity, Wisdom and Glory.
The world is worthy of our love,
we should each transcend out limits, high and above.
We must all reach for knowledge and wisdom and awake,
forget leaders we can&apos;t ever know if they are true or fake.
We are one family, one world, one nation,
and the only thing dividing us is lack of education.
It is really hard to see,
how powerful Knowledge and Wisdom can be.
Maybe, think of it as knowledge received,
from lives you have not lived.
Once we all take to wisdom, real education will become first,
then we&apos;ll unite, and take down all the nuclear missiles that have us cursed.
Only then will we know,
how far is humanity able to go.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Wisdom is the substance with which Humanity grows,
and it is also the might with which every hero rose.
There cannot be a united world without a wise voter,
systems of politics can&apos;t work like a motor.
Corruption comes out of most people wanting to appear smart,
but their incompetence does not end when they depart.
Not only are they replaced by more of the same,
but the policies they set continue wandering without an aim.
Systems as such expand until they seize and fall,
then from the ashes can only rise a wall after wall.
It is because pretenders when pressed can only pretend more,
liars can only destroy a nation and lead it to war.
A nation must first help its uneducated, poor, and weak,
because poverty prevents people from learning and makes the future bleak.
Then, to power a system the voter must be educated and wise,
otherwise they can only contribute to the system&apos;s demise.
We cannot hope to build a peaceful nation,
if we do not begin with functional and real education.
Cognitive biases alone,
will corrupt a politician down to the bone.
But their real curse is such,
that they can&apos;t know, that they don&apos;t know very much.
Fake it until you make it, is not a driving force,
it is a mode of being rotten at the source.
Alas, we are too beautiful to allow politicians to sell it all,
we will turn our heads away from their madness and their fall.
A day will come, when they call for their wars,
but we&apos;ll be too busy, tearing down walls, and opening windows, and doors.
The future generations should look towards the internet,
building a world united by a peaceful mindset.
A world build far and above geographic borders,
one that is connected by Education and Compassion, not just orders.
But, we cannot Unite - without Wisdom and Schools,
today we do not yet have the necessary tools.
Non the less, the symbol of the Withe Dove,
will continue waiting for Humanity to unite, in Wisdom and Love.

and find something our elder selves may wish to have known.
We learn best out of curiosity and in need,
and to so start we need a direction and a seed.
A direction is set by something cool,
and a seed makes us feel like we need to go back school.
That&apos;s when you know you have something fun,
something that will challenge you until you are done.
A challenge is a wonderful quest,
something that will keep you learning until you do your best.
Please, stop walking the same road,
take your leap of curiosity; learn to paint, or dance, or code.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Myths were invented to describe amazing people,
and I&apos;ve seen many amazing creatures in my journeys.
One time out in Nordhouse,
out of nowhere popped out a freshly graduated engineer.
He held up a gallon water container that was carrying back to camp,
and the poor mad lad uttered, &quot;8.34 pounds&quot;.
He seemed excited, but also sad,
and I think he was acting so odd because he realized he was forgetting everything.
Plus, I am certain he said pounds,
not kilograms; mad in deed.
Another time, at 6am or so, I was going through maps of south Pacific,
in Ann Arbor, by that strange black metal cube sculpture that squeaks when rotated.
I just had to get away from Ambrosia&apos;s morning clientele,
bless their hearts.
And I&apos;ve noticed that across the park some student was sleeping under an evergreen,
I don&apos;t think she worked in US, I just somehow assumed South America, Amazon.
She stared getting off the ground, and tried to yell that she wasn&apos;t homeless or drunk,
I kept looking into my maps, ignoring her; and she went on her way to get a grant, or give a speech or something.
I am sure she worked in South America,
probably with the natives.
Over in Ludington, there was this one time a little girl was feeding Seagulls with her mom,
and just as I noticed the commotion...
one of the Seagulls,
went, all, out!
Right in her hair,
I felt so bad, and her mother was only barely able to contain her laughter.
She puffed up her face as if playing a trumpet,
you could totally tell she had enough of that kid, and she was getting payback for all her hissy fits.
And then there is this... story that is most Dearest to me,
one of my happiest memories, that I swore I would never talk about because I am far too mature.
Alas, this is what All Hallows&apos; Eve is all about,
talking about strange creatures, and wonderful memories.
It was an beautiful early morning,
I was sitting by my breakfast fire.
Mostly listening to birds, and probably angry bears,
whilst squiggling in my journal, about poems, and programs.
This was a large and beautiful camp site full of tress,
they had clean showers, and proper restrooms.
I had the first camp site on the Orchid Loop,
and I noticed that a couple of giggly middle aged ladies were just getting into the spirit of camping.
They were always happy, and sophisticated,
and laughing, playing some smart radio station, and always full of joy.
This morning the tall one started shimmy shammying first,
she was probably getting around to starting up a fire to make breakfast.
They had all the firewood,
and swe was singing something, it was unusual for people to make so many happy little noises during a stay there.
She quieted down a bit,
and lit her fire.
And as she bent over to pick up some twigs to get things going,
she fired off that old familiar sound that one would expect from a constipated and uncultured, filthy, lactose intolerant old man.
And, oh my gosh,
all of a sudden all the birds went quiet.
It was just this unusual deafening silence,
and that&apos;s just half the story, because all of a sudden this sophisticated wealthy woman goes:
&quot;Puull my finga&quot;
In the worst fake southern accent she could possibly conjure up,
and with the longest drawl.
And then she quickly skedaddled back to her camper,
- probably to change, and lay down a bit.
This must have been ten years ago or more,
and I still haven&apos;t forgotten about it.
Happy Halloween,
Everyone.

                  <span class="text-muted">Some secrets are right there,
in the sand, they lay bare.
For a few days,
I, manned that blaze.
I lit a fire so great,
that it moved me, to create.
I didn&apos;t have much in my tent,
in my wallet, I didn&apos;t have a singe cent.
I lived in a castle, built by a gigantic dune,
its halls hummed that ancient tune.
In the day I&apos;d gather firewood,
come the eve I&apos;d have a potato, that tasted so good.
I neither searched for a beginning nor the end,
I merely wanted to find idea&apos;s edge, to my own content.
It was right there,
but it was not in the horizon, nor the fire&apos;s flare.
It was in living at a proper pace,
and sleeping in the right place.
The pace at which you live your days,
must match your interest, and remain, in phase.
Composing Music and Painting Art,
are unique and worlds apart.
In art we race to paint,
but in music we must practice restraint.
The eye can&apos;t see,
what the ear can hear.
Though both require layers to become thick,
paintings rain, while music goes tick by tick.
Each requires a different place,
and a walk about at a distinct pace.
There are many out there that move all wrong,
sadly, they will never finish their painting, or their song.
And when it was time go back whence I came,
I rolled up my tent, and put out the flame.
Somebody else down the trail, instantly lit another fire,
and pondered their own wisdom, to their own desire.
I waddled back, my painted walking stick in hand,
slowly marking notes, beats, and measures in the sand.
Now, whenever I try to learn something new,
I wait for time to give me a clue.</span>
