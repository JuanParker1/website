                    <p>Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence are a fine method,</p>

                    <p>It is easy to trick ourselves that we know enough, that we will do enough,</p>
                    <p>but to test ourselves we only need to see if we can write a meaningful book.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But there is other trickery at play,</p>
                    <p>one that is related to the level of our knowledge, and the content of the culture we grow up in.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>This is a more formidable problem,</p>
                    <p>thus the Thinking Tools are more complex.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Authenticity exposes weakness and lessons,</p>
                    <p>and The Culture of Pursuits of Excellence, sets us on an adventure of the lifetime.</p>

                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We tend to make decisions that result in not what we wanted,</p>
                    <p>our intent suffers from not enough experience, knowledge and information.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A good abstract example of that,</p>
                    <p>is navigating dark woods.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Without a map we maybe headed in the wrong direction,</p>
                    <p>with a map; we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The more we know, the better we navigate,</p>
                    <p>a powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,</p>
                    <p>Memoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.</p>

                    <p>If we are taught a falsehood about the world,</p>
                    <p>we will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>A good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,</p>
                    <p>teaching their children that the other is evil.</p>

                    <p>It is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,</p>
                    <p>we tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.</p>

                    <p>Let me give you an example,</p>
                    <p>that your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.</p>

                    <p>When we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,</p>
                    <p>even though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.</p>
                  </section>

                    <p>No matter what,</p>
                    <p>we still believed.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,</p>
                    <p>we saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,</p>
                    <p>some of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We accepted grades,</p>
                    <p>and we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,</p>
                    <p>we still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,</p>
                    <p>and finally noticed that a diploma didn&apos;t even guarantee a well-paying job.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Late on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,</p>
                    <p>but a source of regret, a force of erosion.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Many of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,</p>
                    <p>and never said a single bad thing about schools.</p>
                  </section>

                    <p>Now let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both</p>
                    <p>The Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.</p>

                    <p>Authenticity.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Accept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.</p>
                    <p>that&apos;s how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Next time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,</p>
                    <p>also ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Dignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,</p>
                    <p>now add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Often times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,</p>
                    <p>it means that we were purposefully misled.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>With Authenticity in our Heart,</p>
                    <p>we get an extra moment to ourselves.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,</p>
                    <p>you are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>No longer will you feel compelled to cram,</p>
                    <p>because it will feel inauthentic.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>After all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,</p>
                    <p>is not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Authenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,</p>
                    <p>because one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>However, the price we pay for ease,</p>
                    <p>is that we don&apos;t really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>Pursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.</p>
                    <p>You start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>This is more challenging, than cramming for tests,</p>
                    <p>but this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,</p>
                    <p>is the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>If that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,</p>
                    <p>or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+Startup+Accelerator">Startup Accelerator</a>, or your own company from zero.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Then you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,</p>
                    <p>as you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Knowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,</p>
                    <p>and at a pace that helped you retain most.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">As winter nears,
and snow appears.
You need not worry,
it is not end of Summers&apos;s glory.
Simply, look at weather, in Florida Keys,
no doubt it will be 83 or more degrees.
Often Georgia is also very nice,
and it is not too far, and may suffice.
Don&apos;t let snow make you fell lonely or sad,
because things aren&apos;t that bad.
Plus.
There is a couple more reasons,
for one, the equator reverses seasons.
And two, there are people that walk from Georgia to Maine,
from early Spring to Autumn they hardly ever complain.
Those are the Appalacian Trail Hikers of course,
beautiful, powerful, and as strong as many a horse.
From Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin they walk,
crossing every mountain, valley, woodland, and rock.
So if Winter ever makes you feel sad,
then it is time for change, and you should be glad.
Because, wintry sadness is a universal call,
a call for adventure, that rings in us all.
Whether you are only going to drive to Georgia and back,
go all the way to the Keys, or start shopping for a backpack.
Growing up is something that people who love you, want you to do,
they know that to thine own self, you must be true.
Our lives are precious and we are not workers of any kind,
we are dreamers and thinkers and we are not meant to live blind.
You are at your most beautiful when you are Happy and Strong,
grab your loved ones and have them come along.</span>

you will discover, the new moon.
While the day is full of light,
it is not over, till midnight.
Because, once your eyes get used to the night,
the moon and the stars, become almost as bright.
Though many, may count their sheep,
an adventurer need not yet go, to sleep.
Please, believe me, there are sights to see!
there is a second world out here, and night is key.
Aside from the occasional streak of silent owl,
you may catch a pack of coyotes, look up, and howl.
Some grasses by the beach glow blue,
static electricity can create a breathtaking view.
Over in the ocean all the glowing fish come out,
they look like stars, when scattered about.
And the moon does not glow, it carries a reflection of the sun,
the photons touched it, and now touch us, in their cosmic fun.
The trees take on a whole new life in the moonlight,
rich green fragrant watchers of your campsite.
The night in many ways is just as bright as the day,
if you have never been on an adventure... please don&apos;t delay.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">When you drive long enough,
you will inevitably find yourself far away from everything.
Now, you have to be courageous,
as first few days are going to be filled with doubt.
Once you get through it,
and the daily stresses let go of you, you will become you.
And if you give it long enough,
you&apos;ll find yourself wondering how you got here.
The answer is almost always,
&quot;By making excuses for people, that didn&apos;t deserve them.&quot;
This falls back on judging people by that age,
and not by their wisdom, class, and maturity.
Anybody can age,
but the pursuit of wisdom is a great challenge.
Just as soon as you stop making excuses,
as you stop filling in the blanks, you are placed on a path towards wisdom.
While you do need your books,
and narrated books are best, the journey is also very important.
You can&apos;t hear the wisdom of a book,
until you get on that path.
And let me precisely state what that path is,
so that there is no room for confusion here.
It is,
The Path Of Adventure.
I was sitting in my coffee shop,
I went there because it once had Tolstoy on the bookshelves.
But, I&apos;ve noticed that things have changed,
and people were not growing up, they were running in circles, curving inwards.
I sat in the rocking chair,
it was the first time, it felt nice.
I rose,
and made it to Tennessee.
I could feel the Spirit of Adventure,
but there was this enormous responsibility to help people grow.
I was too young to be heard,
though I have a faint memory of someone calling me Mother Hen somewhere.
Georgia, I made it to Georgia next,
but instead of turning around, I slept at a rest area.
I woke up, and kept going,
until the highways I was on, turned to US Highway One.
I pulled up by the beautiful beach,
and I walked into the Amazing and warm Ocean.
Standing On The Edge Of The Universe,
I called it.
It was wonderful,
the stars came out, I&apos;ve noticed little glowy fishes swimming about.
On my way pack,
I shout right past my city, and kept on driving.
And yet again I ended up on another beach,
this time in Ludington, Michigan.
Here I overheard someone mention,
Nordhouse Dunes.
I set off immediate, I&apos;ve never seen dunes that big before,
they looked like mountains, to me.
I begun sleeping at a different campsite each day,
then I discovered a little dune that reminded me of a volcano.
And I have spent many days there,
I have listened to many audio books on top of my little volcano.
I discovered how much there is to wisdom,
and what is more, that most of our wisdom has to come from within us.
Daily stresses, and unimportant worries,
trying to speak to people who never listen, is not healthy.
Before we try to help others grow,
we must become wise, and much, much older.
People must be ready to listen,
before they can hear and comprehend what you are sharing.
Express your concern for others,
but not by being pulled into problems of people that don&apos;t listen.
Write, and narrate your books, write to those who are searching for wisdom,
and you will be heard and adored the world over.
Now, go set off on your beautiful adventure,
may you discover all the wisdom and fathom more.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Sometimes writing journals becomes a chore,
because page after page the darn thing begs for more.
Slowly it becomes a bore,
and so as we grow, writing turns into a thing of yore.
I think, writing poetry is the best,
as here your language takes you on a little quest.
You can write very little and even in jest,
and it still comes out with grrrreat zest.
Moreover,
many do not wish to read long pages,
as getting to the end would take them whooooole ages.
And, some may wish to read your thing twice,
or may even wish to enjoy it thrice.
And here brevity is king,
short little things are just the thing.
So if it has been a long time since you writ,
dig up your journal and lay down some fancy wit.
And if you never wrote before, you&apos;re in luck,
lookup word families or find a a rhyming dictionary, and pluck!</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each lesson must add to the next one,
we hardly need to push ourselves.
It sooo important that you start with something you like,
it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.
There area always extras that come alongside,
and they change everything.
Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,
maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.
Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,
you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.
I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,
but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.
Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,
it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.
A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,
sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.
One example that comes to mind is the Ohm&apos;s Law,
you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.
Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,
you can&apos;t connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.
So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,
then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.
Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,
you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.
You see what the problem is, of course,
in schools, they don&apos;t teach by means of practical applications.
They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,
which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.
If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,
and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.
But they don&apos;t do that,
we have to do that.
And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,
it is all those little things we are interested in.
And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,
they won&apos;t know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.
See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,
so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.
And then come our retirement, we&apos;ll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,
and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.
It is the only way the world can grow,
and there is much growing up ahead of us.
