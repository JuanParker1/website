                      that the more successful Alternative Education Systems should become the

                    <p>I think that some day we maybe able to find great schools, and people like
                      Sir Robinson will help that day come. But it will be too little too late,
                      certainly for us. In this final chapter I will ask you to take Extreme
                      Ownership of Your Education, and here is Jocko Willink explaining the
                      gravity of the words Extreme Ownership.</p>

                      <h2>Extreme Ownership</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Extreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means <strong>Self Education</strong>. It
                      means learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence that
                      matches you the best. This is also the meaning of the opening quote by Sun
                      Tzu <em>&#x201C;Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated
warriors go to war first and then seek to win.&#x201D;</em></p>
                    <p>Education is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing up, it
                      is about being healthy, and strong. Regardless of where you are headed,
                      whether or not that direction includes Medical School, or a University. You
                      need to Self Educate before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroom
                      may not be the place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.</p>
                    <p>Setting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many years, or
                      even decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can fit in a
                      sentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyG430I2nk">Zizek!</a>,
                      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwmum5_ofU">Examined Life</a>, and now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxRj9JWQMs">Democracy</a> further explains, and I think
                      serves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.

                    </header>
                    <p>The beginning of self education starts with a class of teachers often
                      called Science Popularizers. They don&#x2019;t just teach science, but also
                      restore the connecting lines between all the Daughters of Philosophia,
                      lines lost due to the bleaching effect that categorization of knowledge,
                      standardization of sequence of learning, and standardized testing causes.</p>
                    <p>The Storytelling of Science is a good overview of who these teachers are,
                      how they think, of their energy and class.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Education is simply too important to be put in someone else&#x2019;s hands. It is
                      your mind, your life, your growing up, your own responsibility. Above all,
                      your body of knowledge has massive infuence over your private
                      decision-making, over your freedom of choice, over your freedom of will.
                      Decision-making is one of the most sacred things in life, and only you
                      should have control over that.</p>
                    <p>I urge you to forget the idea that you must be taught to learn. I urge you
                      to accept that great responsibility yourself. You must take extreme
                      ownership of your own Self Education.</p>

And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished. The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen. We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses. Nietzsche Viktor Frankl State of Mind INVICTUS - W. E.

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
