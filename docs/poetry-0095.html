        <p>It is a pretty dark trick,<br>
          and it makes life run out all too quick.</p>
        <p>If all were to be tricked to break the link,<br>
          that they can&apos;t climb on giants to think;</p>
        <p>And all became mere muscle and bone,<br>
          humanity would fade in vain, with a deathly moan.</p><br>
        <p>We have to remind each other, so that we don&apos;t forget,<br>
          or we will fade, without feeling a hint of regret.</p>
        <p>You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>
          you are finely crafted for the Art of Seeing.</p>
        <p>With your unstoppable sight,<br>
          as your greatest might...</p>
        <p>You can understand anything,<br>
          and rise higher than any king,<br>
          it is your right!</p><br>
        <p>You are meant to rise, at least to the status of a Hero,<br>
          keep people from running themselves into a zero.</p>
        <p>That power is in each and every one of us,<br>
          and we must be Noble and Wise,<br>
          so that no one can stop us.</p>
        <p>Know with certainty that it is always Spring Season,<br>
          to stand up for Truth &amp; Reason.</p>
        <p>Know that Truth and Beauty is always right,<br>
          and yours, is that Power and Might.</p>
