                    <p>Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop,
                      and often block traffic.</p>
                    <p>If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want
                      to do their job, go home, and get paid.</p>
                    <p>If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw
                      you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job
                      and go watch some TV.</p>
                    <p>You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&apos;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot;

                    <p>There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you
                      realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too
                      low.</p>
                    <p>Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education,
                      the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot;
                      grades, making your parents happy.</p>
                    <p>Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up
                      excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never
                      looking back.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only
                        the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to
                        teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>
                      <p>I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish
                        to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>
                      <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so
                        sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a
                        broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to
                        its lowest terms...</p>

And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.

Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
