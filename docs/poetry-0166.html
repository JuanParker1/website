          <p>Endurance, like speaking, or memorizing poems, and languages languages,<br>
            or recalling details on the walls of our childhood home, streets of our city,<br>
            is a talent we are all born with.</p>
          <p>Like memorizing a poem, or learning a language it is a slow process,<br>
            we adapt gradually, and gradually we must increase the difficulty of our workout.</p>
          <p>Dancing, or Jogging with dumbbells is a nice example,<br>
            we can extent duration of our workout or the distance of our run,<br>
            increase the beat of the music or our pace,<br>
            and of course slowly increase the weight of the dumbbell.</p><br>
          <p>This requires a long time, a daily routine,<br>
            but the gentler it is, the more frequently it can be done.</p>
          <p>Running a 10K every morning is probably too tiring,<br>
            the body will grow weaker rather than adapt to handle more,
            certainly at first.</p>
          <p>Running a Dumbbell-10K every other day,<br>
            seems to work out well, and the door to increasing distance is open.</p>
          <p>This is a good example of increasing frequency, being a bad idea,<br>
            but being able to run longer with heavier dumbbells, being well within reach.</p><br>
          <p>Without gradually sneaking in more difficulty,<br>
            the workout won&apos;t progress as well as it could, but it will still progress.</p>
          <p>Open-world workouts like dancing or jogging with dumbbells,<br>
            help with burning fat, and build up useful muscles that protect us from injury.</p>
          <p>Waking up to crispy and fresh air, putting on your gear,<br>
            and getting out there with dumbbells in hand is a wonderful way to enjoy a morning sunrise.</p>
          <p>If you have to stay home, then know that there is a wonderful alternative to jogging,<br>
            and that is dancing grab your dumbbells and begin by mastering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_shuffle">Melbourne Shuffle</a></p>
