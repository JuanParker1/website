          <p>When you were a baby you could see the world well enough,<br>
            but what made a difference was watching it for a while.</p>
          <p>By observing the world we made sense of it,<br>
            we noticed how things connect; and learned to participate.</p><br>
          <p>But we are also very good at becoming better,<br>
            and we won&apos;t notice a mis-observation.</p>
          <p>Overwork, is one such thing,<br>
            it makes everyone proud and happy, and it makes sense to try to make them even happier.</p>
          <p>But, that is a mistake,<br>
            because your Life, your Living, and your search for meaning is far more important.</p><br>
          <p>We have to continue observing the world,<br>
            we can&apos;t just keep going forward based on observations we made as children.</p>
          <p>We have to notice that Poverty is a stupid problem,<br>
            it should not be a part of modern society.</p>
          <p>No one should be homeless, no one should ever be hungry,<br>
            and no one should suffer from a sustained thereat of poverty.</p>
          <p>It will only eve get fixed if you stop overworking,<br>
            and start growing all the way up until you become a Great Being.</p><br>
          <p>And we have to look at life from the point of view of Universe,<br>
            it is the Greatest Thing, there cannot be greater.</p>
          <p>The Cosmos gave birth,<br>
            we have emerged out of chaotic atoms and their configurations.</p>
          <p>It is not just a disgrace to surrender our minds,<br>
            but also some kind of a Cosmic Crime.</p><br>
          <p>A mind must grow,<br>
            to no end, and nothing is allowed to stop it. or hurt it.</p>
          <p>Only from continued observation, and unimpeded growth,<br>
            will we absorb enough of our surroundings,<br>
            and inherit enough from the books that touch us,<br>
            to find our &quot;meaning&quot; for the lack of a better word.</p>
          <p>MEANING, is the thing we notice when we look back from within the winter of our life,<br>
            it is our Greatest Thing from the Greatest Time of our Life.</p>
          <p>Overwork, fatigue, confusion, being too tired to learn or read,<br>
            being too scared, or too worried,<br>
            or focusing on things that are just unimportant in the end.<br>
            Will interfere with our growing up, and our search.</p><br>
          <p>Please be careful my friends, be especially mindful of uttering these words,<br>
            &quot;Oh, I can&apos;t do that anymore, I have a job now.&quot;.</p>
          <p>Becoming a professional is useful though not required,<br>
            Nurse, Mechanic, Programmer, Business Founder, it is all very interesting, captivating,<br>
            but it is not that big of a deal - your Elder Self may see that as &quot;very little&quot;.</p>
          <p>My Dear Friends, having a career and some savings, is the least we can do in life,<br>
            we are all capable of doing, a million times more.</p>
          <p>And it does not mean that our greatest achievements will take a long time,<br>
            no, sometimes it only takes five or ten years, maybe even less, maybe two.</p>
          <p>But it will be that defining creation,<br>
            that will make all our previous works seem a million times smaller.</p><br>
          <p>Socrates, Newton, Nietzsche, Rand, Dawkins, Sam Harris, Craig Venter (to name a few),<br>
            are not super human, are not geniuses.</p>
          <p>They just didn&apos;t let overwork interfere with their mind,<br>
            they didn&apos;t become the best employee, or the best student.</p>
          <p>They observed The World, The Universe, The Earth, The Life, The Human,<br>
            and made their GPA or Promotion, a million times less important.<br>
            In favor of the chain of things that really moved them in their deepest integrity.</p>
          <p>What is your Elder Self trying to say to you,<br>
            what are her regrets?</p>
          <p>Is she saying &quot;Work more?&quot;, &quot;Get more savings.&quot;, &quot;Put yourself in harms way for that promotion!&quot;,</p>
          <p>or is she saying &quot;Pay attention to the Minds around You&quot;,<br>
            &quot;Read more, so that you may inherit the wisdom from the lives of other people.&quot;,</p>
          <p>My Friends,<br>
            make time, fight for time, make serenity, clear your mind,<br>
            so that you may get to that book, and the next one after that.</p>
          <p>Do not merely busy yourselves with what everybody else is doing,<br>
            you are not a rive, you are not to flow into the sea.</p>
          <p>You are a Universe.</p>
          <p>A Universe of Journeys and Adventures, Wisdoms, Curiosities and Passions,<br>
            a unique constellation of ever birthing stars,<br>
            and no one will ever be like you.</p>
          <p>Do not go quietly into the night,<br>
            do not make our Universe darker.</p>
          <p>Live as Bright as The Sun.</p>
          <p>Live as Wise, as the Greatest of Minds,<br>
            when seen from a thousand years in the future.</p>
          <p>May You Change The World.</p>
