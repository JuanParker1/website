                    <p>&quot;It is hard to teach kids who stink.&quot;</p>
                    <p>We must face the misjudgment of the role of poverty in education.</p>
                    <p>We must face the misjudgment of the the gravity of poverty.</p>
                    <p>We must face policy that does not make sense, that will never make sense,
                      due to persistent malformed-understanding of education.</p>
                    <p>Education begins in kindergarten, it is easy to forget this.</p>
                    <p>It begins with mentors, inspiration, friendship.</p>
                    <p>There is no education without human connection, but there is merit in apps,
                      computer programs, videos, audio books, and overhead internet satellites.</p>
                    <p>We need a clear aim, for both, educators, and the kids. There is no clearer
                      aim than becoming a Business Creator, and escaping poverty.</p>
                    <p>Rising to no end in sight. Eventually leaving a worthy legacy. Unbreakable
                      shoulders for other giants to stand on.</p>
                    <p>The cure for poverty bears the same pattern as the cure for broken
                      education. The individual must become a businessperson, just as the student
                      must become her own teacher.</p>

                    <p>It is easy to forget that we have no limits.</p>
                    <p>It is easy to believe the lie, that we can stop because we are not learning

                    <p>It is easy to misunderstand the purpose of Education.</p>
                    <p>We don&apos;t need a generation of Brilliant and Unstoppable Teachers, or Policy

                      too many.</p>
                    <p>Pretending to be wise and authentic is far too easy, to put the future of

                    <p>Even if it wasn&apos;t a fantasy aimed to place responsibility for education

                    <p>We must teach children that they are responsible for their own education,
                      and their own exit from poverty, by means of becoming a business creator.</p>
                    <p>Children need an aim, before they open the textbook.</p>
                    <p>They need persistent enlightenment. Not moronic excuses that they won&apos;t
                      always have a calculator at hand, or sick fantasies of a happy job they
                      will always love performing.</p>
                    <p>We don&apos;t need better teachers, we need and endless supply of Brilliant and
                      Unstoppable Students who accept the responsibility for their own education,
                      at their own pace, and a sequence that matches who they are.</p>

                    <p>Grades must end, because too many children confuse their grade point
                      average with their value to the world.</p>
                    <p>The only reason why someone would ever fail a test, is because the wisdom
                      they already had, was incompatible with what was being taught.</p>
                    <p>To force incompatible knowledge on someone, and blame them for not
                      integrating it, is evil.</p>
                    <p>If you are young and still in school. Begin making unbreakable promises
                      that you will fix what is broken. Help your friends to Audio Books that set
                      them free to understand Science, or travel the Appalachian Trail when
                      waiting for the bus. Help them understand YCombinator and Techstars,
                      Startup Accelerators, Angel Funds.</p>
                    <p>And if you have already left it all behind, now it is time to remember your
                      hopes and dreams. Go back with your wisdom of today, and fix what was
                      broken when you were little. Stand up in the classroom and rage against
                      mediocrity or lies. Take a lesson from Erica Goldson.</p>

                    <p>&quot;Education is not the filling of a vessel, but the kindling of a flame.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The cradle of education is within. The flame of curiosity, lives within.
                      Students reach out and put things into their soul, all the time.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes all it takes is a poem.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the explanation, that all education is really for, is beating
                      back Poverty of Mind-and-Wallet.</p>
                    <p>Poverty that they were unfortunately and unfairly dropped into, and now
                      they must learn wisdom and fight their way out of, and if they so choose,
                      bring back the light so that others may follow.</p>
                    <p>And later, finally, enjoy their existence and high achievement, leave a
                      legacy worthy of following.</p>
                    <p>Never tell a child that life is not fair. That will only force them into
                      accepting their poverty as a given, and your mediocrity as a fact.</p>
                    <p>Education is never! for good grades, or a good resume, or a good job that
                      pays well.</p>
                    <p>Education is for the opposite of Memorization and Servitude.</p>
                    <p>Education is for Creativity, and Freedom.</p>
                    <p>Education is for Originality, and Independence.</p>
                    <p>Education is for Unbrekability, and Leadership.</p>
                    <p>The children you taught to wait for Superman, are, that promise, and the
                      future, and more.</p>
                    <p>And the opposite of high achievement is not failing while daring greatly.
                      Failure is nonsense, just another excuse not to try. There is no such thing
                      as failure. Every step forward adds to success.</p>

Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.

Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
