                    <p>I know all too well that writing books is hard,</p>
                    <p>as far as I can tell; I am still learning English.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But books, share principles, with life,</p>
                    <p>be it book or life, it is always page after page, it has chapters.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Books are not, some fancy extra,</p>
                    <p>but a pretty fancy way of rising, just rising.</p>

                    <p>I suspect that we don&apos;t really get started until our fifth book.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&apos;Cause you know,</p>

                    <p>And, I think I can actually predict enough of it to say,</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>See, it is not until we get there, and glance over at ideas that we were passionate about when young,</p>
                    <p>but now through the eyes of the Great Being... that all of a sudden, things like Amor Fati, are not merely about Love of Fate,</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>But also, from when we look at life,</p>
                    <p>see when looking back we see fate as something that that largely already unfolded.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>And now, the love for it fits,</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>All the battles we fought and learned from regardless it it was triumph or disaster, ease or hardship,</p>
                    <p>it was what we grew <strong>so profound</strong>, what made us, ourselves.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>So as long, as we fought to rise,</p>
                    <p>so as long as it counts for more than whim and being pushed around.</p>
                  </section>

                    <p>It doesn&apos;t matter how hard things were,</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>That we faced those challenges,</p>

                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>See, we have to live our life so sturdily,</p>
                    <p>as to bring enlightenment to our Elder Selves, and perhaps make them cry a little - and why the heck not!</p>

                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And though as children we may need to admit to ourselves that we don&apos;t understand everything,</p>
                    <p>as Great Beings come Our Golden Age, we will understand what we once struggled with.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And with a great sense of accomplishment,</p>
                    <p>a sense of accomplishment that wouldn&apos;t be there, had we not challenged ourselves with things that were out of our grasp when we were young.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>So what may seem as difficulty in our youth,</p>
                    <p>we will end up loving in our Golden Age for making us stronger and more profound.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">It felt so healthy to sit down to the first version,
the promise of creating a program that will change the world felt amazing.
They settled on trusty bare bones express,
and the first routes they put in were view and edit.
Carl Sagan once said, that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,
you must first invent the universe.
Ward Cunningham the inventor of WikiWiki,
has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.
With just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,
in the most simplest way possible.
They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,
the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.
In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,
it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.
For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt
The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,
the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.
If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,
and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,
by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,
every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.
It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,
and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,
this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.
So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,
basically a blank Wikipedia.
So now came the big question,
which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?
They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,
after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.
And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,
cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city
This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.
and they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.
Adding user support had to come in next,
just like every city had a page, so did every user.
Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,
Alice and Bob.
Out in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,
and she named the malicious politician Mallory.
Alice and Bob represented computer programs,
they were chatbots.
However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,
they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.
The bots weren&apos;t really inspired by anything other than old MUD programs but there was a beautiful line of code,
that one of the leads always looked at, line 26 in a sample script of github&apos;s hubot.
The bots were special,
they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.
As a whole they already created a very simple,
but living simulation.
For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,
the bot actually got its information from Detroit&apos;s own weather service.
And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,
that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.
Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,
that made working on the system fun.
But by far the most special thing about bots,
was that they could be replaced by a real human,
by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.
In the next release of the program,
the girls focused on enhancing this feature.
A bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,
but when a real person took over for an account,
they could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.
Even in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,
that a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.
As with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,
but it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,
and in the end large cities would go online within weeks,
because it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.
Cosmopolis 2.0 was what got the attention of United Nations,
but that is a story for another time.
Personal Note,
Becoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,
it becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.
There is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,
that contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.
I recommend learning JavaScript, which is currently called ES2020, to actually execute a program you will need an interpreter.
Your browser has one built in, as JavaScript is the language of the web, look up how to open the web console in your browser of choice.
The industry standard for server-side JavaScript applications like our Imaginary Cosmopolis is Node.js,
if interested you can search for video tutorials to help you get started.

it is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.
It is commonly known as corruption, but that didn&apos;t matter to them,
because they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.
And by everything,
they meant institutions all around the world.
They were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,
&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot;,
The idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,
they would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.
Initially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,
but there was a way to find out.
The thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,
it was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.
The non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,
the bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.
So part of the reason why the programming was so simple,
is that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.
When everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,
and some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.
The thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,
then the program could replace all the management software of a real city.
To their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,
it took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.
They knew that they became famous,
when the UN wouldn&apos;t stop calling.
It worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,
they kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.
The program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,
about 10,000 running copies.
What was fascinating about this,
is that it was still played as a game.
There was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,
that everyone went to for internet news.
The program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML
and to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.
It is a Virtual City at heart,
but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,
it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.
People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,
because their voting history is under their profile.
Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,
some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.
The program as a whole,
eliminated the need for representatives.
People vote on issues that need immediate attention,
and those are the first issues that get solved.
Two amazing things emerged from within the program,
schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),
and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.
Schools started working,
it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.
The second,
people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.
Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,
people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,
the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.
Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,
any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.
People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,
there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.
All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,
so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.
There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,
one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.
The entire process was often ran by bots,
city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.
In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,
were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,
the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,
they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.
Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,
they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.
Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.
The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.
In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.
This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,
again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication
to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.
Prison population dropped.
Nobody called this program a game,
it was always meant to change the world.
The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,
originally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,
But now, decades after the initial release;
the program begun uniting the world.
War, for one became unthinkable,
as people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.
There was no such thing as not having a job,
the cities always needed help with countless tasks.
Corruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,
national borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.
Not that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,
the original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.
What they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,
something that they discovered was once lost in the translation.
Every city now has a sculpture to honor them.
Many of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, &quot;Faster Horses&quot;.
In closing, the conjecture was true.
In the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.
The only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.
It takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.
Where there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Ability to connect with knowledge through audio-books,
and retain that knowledge, as your own,
and build on it to no end, is beyond the powers of Universe.
Inheriting Knowledge to build Wisdom makes you unstoppable,
and once you sit down to write a book of your own you become infinite.
We should not allow anyone to stand between us and our education,
inheritance of knowledge is extremely important to our mental health,
to how we treat each other, and how we interact with the world.
Books are the loveliest things in the world,
my time listening to &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; by Bill Bryson is such a wonderful memory.
I still smile at how shy Henry Cavendish was,
and sometimes I worry about a Kimberlite Pipes popping up somewhere nearby, you never know.
The part where Conway Morris muttered &quot;...not another phylum.&quot;,
got me when I was jogging in the middle of the night at Ann Arbor, MI,
I almost suffocated from laughter.
See a school can&apos;t present knowledge this way,
I know that there are many amazing professors,
but most of them, probably have a fantastic book or series or lectures out.
Knowledge has to be presented with Love and Joy, and maybe a hint of Comedy,
schools of today are coldhearted machines incapable of those emotions.
We can&apos;t just pass the tests that schools expect us to cram for,
we need the actual knowledge, and wonders that will help us become wise.
Life is always asking us to pick a direction,
the wiser we become early on, the happier we will be on the paths we chose.
We must not become tricked into believing we are bad at learning,
there is just no such thing as bad at learning.
Bad grades just prove that middle-school, high-school and college are seriously broken,
the kids that do get good grades and become successful learn outside of school,
and they certainly do not cram before tests they actually learn.
Learning and Schools should not be two separate things,
and there should never be a threat of someone becoming tricked into thinking that they are not smart.
This is a global problem,
the leaders and policy makes who did cram for tests,
they too need a real education that will contribute to their wisdom.
This is not just about fixing High School,
this is about helping Humanity Grow in Wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">A new age is coming,
an age where the younger generations will end tolerance of blind mistakes.
There will be no more business as usual,
for there was never a usual to be had.
The children can see that borders are hurting the world,
political, cultural, and religious borders keep humanity divided and weak.
The only reason for their tolerance of our mistakes today,
is that they still believe in us, they still think we have the answers they are looking for.
But with internet, and disasters, climate change, and continued threats of nuclear war,
more and more children learn to see that Humanity cannot grow as it is today.
They are the future,
and it is their future.
The revolution will be silent,
there will be no battle, they will just wait us out.
They didn&apos;t even need us to do anything special,
just end their poverty, and give them real schools.
They will watch the videos of us helplessly bailing out corruption,
spouting nonsense about how poverty can&apos;t be fixed, because that&apos;s not how money works.
All the way down,
until all markets collapse to nothing.
This is not a poem about Global Warming and Economic Collapse,
this is a poem about Naked Emperors, and Authenticity.
This is a poem about Real Schools,
that make a real difference for all the kids, most of which still look up to us.
Elementary school is working,
it is perfect, and those teachers are still The Cheerful Heroes they have always been.
Middle School, breaks down under fake education,
as we fail to teach tools for thinking, and sell our children for a small paycheck.
High School, is where the kids figure out it is all fake,
and come home with bad grades to call you out.
College and University,
finally manages to break their beautiful hearts.
Open curriculum, brand name education, networking with the past graduates, lose leaf text books,
debt, and sweet infantile dean feeling shy for wearing the school brand underwear, that one last day of the semester.
That was not a graduation speech old man, that was pain and fear,
that was the declaration that the Emperor is Naked.
The best of the kids who do go through the process,
learn that the can but help a person, a village, but there is no way for them to help the whole world.
Jumping all the hoops does not provide the solutions the entire world needs,
we have to have faith in the future generations enabled by real education, that is our only hope.
Give the kids a school, that will teach them for real,
while there is still a better future to be had.
A school that is worthy of the Infinitely Creative Genius that they really are,
stop pushing them through the mockery of education that removes their unique connection to Knowledge,
and replaces it with Memorization and Fake Grades
Each Human Being has a unique way of connecting with Knowledge and Wisdom,
and every one of those ways has a path that moves at a perfect pace-and-sequence through the sciences.
It can be music, and then Alan Walker, and lmms, and a cover of Alone,
and then the world of programming, and mathematics and signal processing.
It can be Games, Graphics, Game Design, Trigonometry,
Astrophysics, and Orbital Dynamics, and Astrobiology.
It can be Art, a tin of pencils, and a classroom of students,
and inspiration, and speaking, and internship at the UN, and finally Presidency.
It can be Adventure, and bugs, and Photography,
and Film Making, and the Documentary that helps Earth awake in time.
Their paths are much shorter then the ones that strip them off their natural predispositions,
and confine them into rows like slaves,
and cut up knowledge into preached cubes void of sense,
and slow them down to a crawl by presenting incomprehensible lectures,
and memorization games for nothing.
That stupid pointless aim, to keep getting funding,
and pay the staff, so that everyone keeps their crappy jobs,
at the price of the future, and the best minds of our generation.
The result of this madness,
is children losing faith in their own Genius,
and in the Power of Education, and Knowledge and Wisdom.
This is where whoever is left,
that still has strength left,
needs to step in.
Help them regain the belief that they are geniuses,
and that we are all equally gifted.
Help them to Audio Books,
because schools are now hurting them.
Do not let the Little Ones,
give up on their Genius.
We are all gifted, we are all geniuses,
we must all comprehend the world&apos;s leading science books.
We must all grow in Authenticity, in Dignity,
in Insight and Foresight.
For All The Future...

Each student will mark their own trail with their own curiosities,

Education will be life long,

There will be less potential for war,
Humanity will converge on the same body of good ideas.
