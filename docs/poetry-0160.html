          <p>If you grant me, that growing up is more than mere aging,<br>
            and that the other component is Intellectual Development.</p>
          <p>And if we agree that we each start near zero,<br>
            and carry on upwards eventually becoming unique and creating undiscovered paths.</p>
          <p>And if we agree that this idea cannot be used to belittle people,<br>
            it can only be used for growing up, and towards Humanity&apos;s Noblest goals.</p>
          <p>Then,<br>
            there is something you should know.</p>
          <p>You can&apos;t speak to all people who are still developing on different heights and in different paths,<br>
            not in the same language, and each unique height will carry unique concepts that can&apos;t translate.</p>
          <p>While we share a lot,<br>
            we don&apos;t share enough to communicate in ways that help us converge towards Wisdom.</p>
          <p>There cannot be a single language with shared deeply held beliefs,<br>
            on subjects that relate to progressing forward or upward.</p>
          <p>Each,<br>
            must learn to translate, interpret and understand the other.</p>
          <p>The speakers who who speak only on their own intellectual level,<br>
            and from within their own culture are not enough to help the world grow.</p>
          <p>Nor will there ever be a single mountain peak where we all converge,<br>
            there can only be a certain height that will help cultures understand each other.</p>
          <p>But, we do share the act of rising up, of growing up towards Wisdom,<br>
            of standing in relentless pursuits of excellence.</p>
          <p>And,<br>
            of helping each other so that we may grow in Peace.</p>
