          <p>I like riding around on my bicycle,<br>
            but today I felt like an icicle.</p>
          <p>Just got back from this years first long ride,<br>
            I feel cheerful and mighty satisfied.</p>
          <p>All the cute creatures are still there,<br>
            and thankfully, still no signs of angry bear.</p>
          <p>Riding alone, I reminisced about a warmer time,<br>
            when a car slowed down and screamed like there was some crime.</p>
          <p>I had no idea what they were saying,<br>
            but waiving their hands, it was a danger they were portraying.</p>
          <p>But, I was like, &quot;Oh, whopped do, who knows...&quot;<br>
            and in the next moment, I had to take off most of my clothes.</p>
          <p><img src="image/poetry-0068-noclothes.jpg" alt="No Clothes"></p>
          <p>I have never been in such great rain,<br>
            it was like standing next to a burst water main.</p>
          <p>I loved it, the rain was fragrant, fresh and warm,<br>
            I could never call that a storm.</p>
          <p>The sun came out instantly, I was like &quot;K. rain, thanks, bye.&quot;,<br>
            and then I had to hang out all my clothes to dry.</p>
          <p>The 13 mile ride back home was full of mud,<br>
            I had to lift my legs, and will my bike across a flood.</p>
          <p><img src="image/poetry-0068-mud.jpg" alt="Mud"></p>
          <p>I am so glad no one will ever know about this,<br>
            but still, these are the memorable moments
            that make me reminisce.</p>
