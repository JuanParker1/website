        <p>I woke up at five,<br>
          and I felt alive.</p>
        <p>I left at five forty two,<br>
          I could still smell the dew.</p>
        <p>The sun was still down,<br>
          and the clouds looked brown.</p><br>
        <p>But I ran,<br>
          like Superman.</p>
        <p>I had weights in each hand,<br>
          ready to conquer Westland.</p><br>
        <p>Though by the time I got to Central City,<br>
          I felt just about as strong as a little kitty.</p>
        <p>But I kept going,<br>
          and the sky started glowing.</p>
        <p>It was really pretty,<br>
          ...the sunrise finally came to the city.</p>
        <p>There was a cloud or two,<br>
          but that only added to the view.</p><br>
        <p>I ran much faster, like I had superpowers,<br>
          and made the six miles under two hours.</p>
        <p>It is my best time thus far,<br>
          and I felt like a superstar.</p>
        <p>But, I have a lot more training to do,<br>
          ...though I must say, I already grew.</p><br>
        <p>I love how I am making proggres jooging<br>
          and bodybuilding and blogging...</p>
        <p>...and all at the same time,<br>
          that sure is a lot of adventure and rhyme.</p>
