                      <h2>A Short Introduction To Commands</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>A command is a program made easy to execute. In other words by turning a
                      program into a command, the programmer standardizes the execution and
                      customization of the program.</p>
                    <p>Usually programs need compilation, or an interpreter, they need some
                      libraries. Often programs may need to be configured somehow, be it a
                      configuration file, or just editing code. Programs may be hard to run,
                      because every program is different.</p>
                    <p>When a programmer decides to turn his program into a command, something
                      wonderful happens. The programmer adds a bunch of stuff to his program to
                      make it into a command, and thus <em>standardizes</em> the way the program is ran
                      and customized.</p>

                    <p>Here is what a command really looks like:</p>
                    <p>command-name --some-argument value-of-the-argument</p>
                    <p>gmail --recipient alice@aol.com --subject &quot;I can&apos;t even!&quot; --message &quot;I

                    </header>
                    <p>Commands usually come in groups, for example there is a group of commands
                      that manage files and directories, a group of commands that compress files,
                      or download files across the internet.</p>

                      with a graphic user interface (GUI), then you don&apos;t need to worry about
                      these.

                      <h2>File Download Command</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Some commands are so good at what they do there is only a couple of them
                      <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wget.1.html">wget</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/curl.1.html">curl</a> are a good example of that. cURL downloads files
                      really well, it is also very frequently used for debugging or testing
                      web-servers that serve files, it is a very efficient program. wget is
                      awesome at resuming downloads and downloading large files, it actually has
                      a feature that not only downloads a web page, but also all the images and
                      other web pages that are linked to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are also some really eyebrow raising commands like <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md">youtube-dl</a>
                      which comes with an --extract-audio argument, meaning, it will make an mp3
                      out of a video.</p>
                    <p>I don&apos;t know what Alphabet&apos;s Terms of Service state on the subject of
                      downloading their data. I don&apos;t recommend you use this command, unless you
                      familiarize yourself with their Terms of Service, specifics of downloading
                      content with third-party tools, and own the content yourself. Note that it
                      is not just a YouTube account that may get suspended, but all the rest too,
                      gmail and google docs, stuff on your android phone, etc.</p>
                    <p>Here is what the command would look for a YouTube Creator hoping to make a
                      backup of a particular video.</p>
                    <p>youtube-dl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR%5C_VIDEO%5C_ID">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\_VIDEO\_ID</a></p>
                    <p>And here is the code for saving just the audio it self, this is useful for
                      making an audio only version of an adventure video or remixing your content
                      in a song.</p>
                    <p>youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3
                      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR%5C_VIDEO%5C_ID">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\_VIDEO\_ID</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Look how simple and easy to read. Commands can save you from thousands of
                      mouse clicks and hours of annoying, repetitive work. Commands are a
                      beautiful invention. Graphic user interfaces are helpful when learning
                      computers, but eventually they will force you into a world of clicks.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Originally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable, readable, and
                      not causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are well thought out.
                      But, people will cram a lot more than they should, and it gets out of
                      control, here is a mild example of mixing some video files with the ffmpeg
                      command.</p>
                    <p>ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy
                      -acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio</p>
                    <p>I have some guesses as to what the ff stands for. You can visit the manual
                      page here: <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg">https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg</a></p>

                    <p>There is a feature in the command world, that can deal with high
                      complexity, and that is the pipe. Meaning two commands can be connected by
                      a pipe in the following manner</p>
                    <p>print &quot;hello world&quot; | uppercase</p>
                    <p>This would result in changing all text to uppercase, and printing it on the
                      screen.</p>
                    <p>HELLO WORLD</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>In The Wizard chapter we learned not to confuse the operating system, with
                      the user interface; as those are two separate kinds of computer programs.</p>
                    <p>Now we learn that UNIX is an operating system with a user interface
                      classified as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">Command-line interface</a>, let us take a closer look at
                      the command-line interface.</p>

                      <h2>Uniformity of Commands</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Once you learn the shape that a command can take, you will be able to use
                      any command on any system.</p>
                    <p>Let us proceed with an imaginary command &quot;print&quot; that has some extra
                      features.</p>

                      <h2>Command Documentation</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Most well behaved commands can be executed with the --help argument, or the
                      -h flag to print some helpful documentation.</p>
                    <p>print --help</p>
                    <p>Popular commands will come with manual pages that can be read with the man
                      command. In this case we would execute: man print</p>

                      <h2>The Simplest Form</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>In the following example there is one argument &quot;hello world&quot;. Without
                      quotes the command would see two arguments &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot;. Quotes are
                      used to join two or more things together.</p>
                    <p>print &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
                  </section>

                    <header>
                      <h2>The Extended Form</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>In the next example we have a Boolean flag &quot;-u&quot; meaning enable underline
                      mode. To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have
                      the extended argument &quot;--format&quot; followed by a directive &quot;capitalize&quot;.
                      Supported directives can be found in documentation.</p>
                    <p>print -u --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
                    <p>To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended
                      arguments, so --format can become -f.</p>
                    <p>print -u -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
                    <p>Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that
                      begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.</p>
                    <p>print --underline -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
                    <p>For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.</p>
                    <p>print --underline --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Because of the uniformity of command syntax. Once you know how to run one
                      command, you know how to run them all. You just need to pull up the
                      documentation to see what all the commands are and what arguments they
                      accept.</p>

                    <p>Please read <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts">github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts</a> Which &quot;hack&quot; this poor
                      bastard&apos;s coffemaker, soon to be ruined romantic life, a particularly needy
                      customer, and alcoholism. Based on a true story, apparently.</p>
                    <p>Please note how the community of geeks that love this story came together
                      and started re-creating these &quot;hacker&quot; scripts in the programming languages
                      they favor; probably out of sadness.</p>
                    <p>Here is the Node.js Version of <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/nodejs/fucking_coffee.js">fucking_coffee.js</a>. Note that once the
                      telnet connection is established at line number 22, we begin using the
                      coffeemaker command-line interface: sys brew (line 26), sys pour (line 32).</p>
                    <p>Don&apos;t think of the coffeemaker as running UNIX, just think of it as it
                      being controlled by a command line interface somewhere.</p>
                    <p>Any machine with a button or two is a system with enough complexity to
                      benefit from a command-line interface.</p>
                    <p>Note how you have never programmed a coffeemaker before, and yet you know
                      precisely - and may even remember for months to come - the commands &quot;sys
                      brew&quot; and &quot;sys pour&quot;.</p>
                    <p>sys brew</p>
                    <p>sys pour</p>
                    <p>It seems sys is a single command that looks at the first text argument.
                      Executing sys -h would probably print:</p>
                    <p> Coffemaker Help ---- -h / --help print this text -v / --verbose print
                      debugging information -b / --brew / or simply brew start brewing -p /
                      --pour / or simply pour start pouring -r / --reboot / or simply reboot
                      reboot the system ... </p>
                    <p>Lack of proper etiquette, and using text (brew) instead of arguments
                      (--brew/-b) can be an indication of sys being a script that does not take
                      the time to parse anything it just looks at the first thing after the
                      command name. It is actually difficult to parse arguments (-b/--brew), it
                      takes no effort at all to use raw text (brew).</p>

                    <p>I was unable to locate the coffeemaker from the story. Personally I&apos;d just

Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett: English political leader, activist, writer and feminist icon. Known as a campaigner for women&apos;s suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until 1919 she led Britain&apos;s largest women&apos;s rights organisation, the National Union of Women&apos;s Suffrage Societies. The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.: Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop, and often block traffic. If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want to do their job, go home, and get paid. If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job and go watch some TV. You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&apos;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot; and you&apos;ll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you&apos;ll struggle to remember where it all started and what the battle was for. Because The Battle Is Not For You: The battle is for those that come; after you. In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the same. In long term, you help the world grow, it won&apos;t be your world, it will be the world of the future. The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education are two separate things. It will make you tired. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood. Bad News: There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too low. Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education, the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot; grades, making your parents happy. Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never looking back. Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue. Henry David Thoreau: I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms... The Good News: Real Education, is not about getting really educated. It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health. Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is not a healthy life. Faith of the Heart Article One: Inherent Dignity, Nobility.: The first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility. No one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or vacation, or else. You are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you are to rage, to rage against the dying of the light.
