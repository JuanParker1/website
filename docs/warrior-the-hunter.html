                    <p>It is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chase

                    <p>We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting
                      without spears.</p>
                    <p>We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.</p>
                    <p>We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.</p>
                    <p>We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that&#x2019;s out optimal diet, the nutrients that
                      we evolved to require for our optimal health.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>My Grandma taught me to ask &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; it is from Latin, it means
                      &quot;Whither goest thou?&quot; or &quot;Where are you going?&quot;.</p>
                    <p>At 3:41 the brave mercenary describes himself as someone who was
                      &quot;Programmed to Destroy&quot;. While he was growing in his wisdom, he perceived
                      the lack of it, as &quot;being programmed&quot;. There is an old saying &quot;A learned
                      servant is not a useful servant&quot;, wisdom set Mr. Mander free.</p>
                    <p>Quo Vadis? is a repeating decision making pattern among the great beings.
                      Mr. Mander in what he calls his &quot;True Act of Bravery&quot; (3:49). Uses it to
                      &quot;ensure [that] there&apos;ll never be separation between who I am, and what I
                      do&quot;, to ensure his Authenticity, Harmony, Dignity, Integrity, Sanity. He
                      also asks &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; in the larger question surrounding both &quot;Does that
                      elephant need its face more than some guy in Asia needs a tusk on his
                      desk?&quot; and &quot;Would I be brave enough to give up everything in my life to try
                      and stop the suffering of animals&quot;. The result of these Authentic Brave
                      Queries is the <a href="https://www.iapf.org/">International Anti-Poaching Foundation</a>. From Mercenary,
                      to a Warrior, a Legend, a Great Being.</p>
                    <p>Lucy Hone is yet another Great Being who employs this type of thinking
                      especially when asking &quot;Is what I&apos;m doing helping or harming me?&quot; see

Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
