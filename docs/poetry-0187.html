                  <span class="text-muted">You are a great inventor, invention is something we do naturally,
but you need to detox from all the hustle and bustle of busy life.
Your private inventions usually build on something someone else did,
so social networks, websites, photography, and maybe art.
If you just sit down with something that fascinates you,
and play with it, you are bound to invent something new.
Let us start with a silly example,
You could create a custom phone ring service, where people yell names...
so when someone calls Alan, the phone actually screams for him.
And here your invention would be about how your relate to voice artists, what tools you give them,
would you also create an addition where the phone yells the name of the person that is calling.
Something more serious would be a social network that takes all your weekly posts,
and creates a part of a chapter in your memoir, here the users can order a paper hard copy,
you could customize this idea by providing beautifully bound books that feature posts from many users,
and you may even simply rely on existing social networks.
Not all starting points require the internet,
or complexity for that matter.
Do you know about Spin Art,
if you could invent a personal touch, maybe something to do with 3D features, or thread,
every Dentist&apos;s Office would feature your fantastic art, your signature, and website address,
and you could even publish a coffee book about your art.
For something less abstract consider building a tilt-shift photography service,
where you get a little drone to fly up to get a giant&apos;s view, and take the most fascinating photos,
for weddings, real-estate, even newspaper articles.
For something more startling, you could start with macro photography,
now entering a realm that everyone can&apos;t help but to be fascinated with,
enormous six foot canvas featuring tiny bugs.
You could even go deeper and do Photomicrography,
and here you enter a world that very few people think about, some may even find your photos unbelievable,
this kind of work would get you featured in national galleries.
If you don&apos;t like still photography, consider setting up cheap time laps cameras all over the place,
and then sell them as background video for speeches, or poetry, or add classical music and call it a new way to hear it,
or call it the study of passage of time, and make a documentary about it, to get at your first Oscar.
Not all inventions need to make money or fame,
but all inventions must fascinate you.
They have to call to your soul,
to your health, to your curiosity.
You have thousands of ideas in your mind,
slow down, get in touch with your Inventive Side,
and help the world become more beautiful.

                  <span class="text-muted">My Friends,
No century is ordinary, and such is the case with this one,
you have a little bit of work to do, you may need to slow down with school and work a bit.
You will be creating a series of books about Real Education, Governing the World,
Human Rights, and a beautiful Survey Course half-jokingly entitled, The Human Manual.
Today computers are everywhere, and they hold a powerful potential,
one that can enhance Education, The Voter and Democracy,
one that can simplify bureaucracies and Governments.
Humanity has been greatly enhanced by the experiment of mandatory education and free access to knowledge,
but the systems of standardized education have fallen behind on times,
we must now use computers to cater to individual students,
and to remove the need of grades, replacing it with a simple history of self chosen subjects.
This a great endeavor,
for which few are ready.
As it always happens in Human History,
this challenge has been pressed upon our shoulders all too soon,
it has been accelerated by Climate Change, Anthropocene Extinction, Mass Incarceration,
and Needles Borders that uselessly Divide our Human Family.
This century a Divided Humanity is a Weak Humanity,
to face all the challenges and to ready the Younger Generations to carry on,
we must unite, the Internet has been Ready for years now.
What follows is an imperfect outline,
of much needed works that aim to Strengthen Humanity,
and help all the children with all the challenges they are soon to face.
Book One: Real Education,
this is a choose your own adventure type experience, that is to be published as a Paper Book,
as an Audio Book, as a Video Book, and finally taught in schools as a series of lectures.
This is very important, My Friends, in 2020, at the time of writing this document,
schools were unable to teach students, they would only force them into memorization,
the motive was to receive state funding so that all school employees would get paid.
(Much will be said on this subject, but much of it won&apos;t matter,
because efficacy of education is _not_ judged by its collective test scores and trends,
but rather; results. Its positive impact on the Voter, and City, State, and Nation Governments,
and above all the well being of our Planet.)
Book Two: Governing The World,
is a book about establishing a Computer Program Managed Democracy,
it is very much an augmented reality, a mirror of our world where our voices count for more.
The program harnesses the Wisdom of the Educated Humanity;
for City, State, Nation, and Earth management.
It is worth noting that it is to have its beginnings as a Interactive Fiction game,
that is collaboratively expanded, much like the world encyclopedia.
Book Three: Human Rights,
is a volume detailing stories about growing up in the world,
it is just essays that highlight what people can do to help the World Grow,
and how to go about it to become triumphant.
This book speaks about a path to a United Humanity,
it is not just about putting an end to the idea of borders as the European Union so nobly demonstrates,
but it is about getting ready to commit all ideas that result in dividing us to history books,
and accepting the fact that we are just one family, that we are the Wise Caretakers of Earth and all of Her Inhabitants.
Human Rights must also highlight the problem of inequality that leads to Incarceration,
people are going to prisons due to lack of Education and Knowledge.
Due to Stress, Poverty. Mental Disorders and Illness some of which is rooted in Neurological Disorders born from poverty, addiction, and unsafe environments.
Prisons must be replaced with Schools,
Human beings do not belong in cages.
Furthermore,
The first and foremost purpose of a Government is to end poverty, homelessness, hunger, and sickness to the best of our abilities.
This means a Universal Basic Income, real money indistinguishable from a paycheck earned by hard work.
People who face Poverty, Hunger, Homelessness, treatable Illness,
who feel isolated or excluded, will be unable to study and comprehend these great Works of Love that this text describes.
We are One Family, we need their help, we need all of Humanity to permanently come together and leave bad ideas behind.
Book Four: The Human Manual,
Is a Book of world&apos;s most inspirational and beloved essays.
It contains the following;
cheerful chapters for Mighty Five Year Olds,
inspiring essays for the Unstoppable Ten Year Olds,
a loving introduction to the complexity of the world for Fifteen Year olds,
and powerful and moving lessons for Teenagers and Twenty-somethings, lessons that many Thirty and Forty Year olds will lovingly return to.
These works are not meant to be set in stone,
the doors to new essays, submissions, and repairs, will always be open.
They are to be translated into all the languages spoken today,
in order to encourage global communication and unity.
These works, are works of the Universal Human Love,
of Human Beings finally coming together to form a Single United Family.
As a United Humanity,
we can easily face all the challenges ahead.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">If loneliness, school, or work has you stressed out,
and in haste you are slowly forgetting where your lines are.
Here&apos;s a bit of magic for you,
it will help you separate who you are, from what you choose to do.
Keep a backpack by your front door,
make sure it is always stuffed full of goodies and ready to go.
Even if it is autumn, or winter,
and there isn&apos;t anywhere to go.
Keep your backpack by the door,
it will remind you that you are free,
and you choose to work hard.
We mustn&apos;t forget that to really sleep,
we must be rested first, and then wait for the sunset.
To really wake up, we have to let our body decide,
we can&apos;t be ripped out of sleep by an alarm.
Each day, must count,
and add to the previous.
And make us stronger, and wiser,
and a bit healthier and overall, better.
If things ever get rough,
it is high time for adventure.
You drive home,
but don&apos;t turn off the car.
Pop in just to grab the backpack,
find a place with decent weather, and ride.
It will take you three days,
to pull your self back together.
And it will be really hard at first,
it will feel like you must go back.
But you can&apos;t live a life,
that is making you lose yourself in haste.
You need to pull yourself together,
and the first three days are the hardest.
The next three days,
will show you that you are returning to normal.
You will sleep longer,
it will feel like a deep breath.
And finally,
you will relax.
And here after a week or two,
you will feel much healthier.
Do not push yourself too hard,
you have to take good care of yourself.
People that care about you will appreciate your well-being,
much more than your hard work.
So, a backpack by the door,
and as a fantastic bonus.
You get to go shopping,
and shopping is the best form of mediation there is.
Start with mosquito repellent sticks that you light on fire,
keep them some distance away from your tent.
Figure out what poison ivy looks like and stay away from it,
leaves of three leave it be, but get some antihistamines and over-the-counter corticosteroid for other bites.
Bring an expensive solar battery charger,
and backup power-bank meant to recharge your specific cell phone a few times.
Audio books are critical, you must not forget.
make sure you at least have Bill Bryson&apos;s &quot;A Walk in The Woods&quot; and &quot;Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;.
Don&apos;t forget to get a good Rambo knife, or two, and preferably cut-proof gloves,
be careful, a sharp knife is often the most &quot;dangerous&quot; thing on your adventure.
You may need a large metal mug for cooking,
or a cooking-kit, often it is just better to sharpen a stick and have a sausage.
Adventure is the best time to practice your chopstick skills,
you&apos;ll never need a fork, if any old stick snapped in half will do.
Bring a fancy hat, and some mighty sunscreen,
don&apos;t let the sun get to you.
A trusty headlamp, with some extra batteries,
will help you in the dark, watch out for owls.
You will need a first aid kit,
duct tape is your friend here,
but get bandage and disinfectant too.
Matches, Zippo, and zippo lighter fluid,
here the fluid will double as fire starter,
and get some fire starter products like wax sticks and candles.
And you will need some para-cord,
for easily dragging firewood to your camp.
Get an inexpensive tent, there are some that are very light weight,
but you are laying down on the ground and your back may not like that.
Some people just travel with a lightweight hammock,
specifically crafted to replace a tent, so get both, and see which one works out.
You will need a sleeping bag,
I always bought the warmest ones.
Get a water-bottle,
and just in case get some water purification tablets.
Toothpaste, toothbrush,
and toiletries.
Always remember to dangle your food on a few feet of para-cord high up in a tree,
it will give the cute little Raccoons a workout, an you&apos;ll get to keep your food.
Raccoons are smart enough to fiddle with your tent zipper until they can get inside,
so get a tiny luggage padlock and lock the zipper eyelets together.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Living is Art,
so lift your brush to the canvas, Dear Friends.
Fatigue, overwork, imbalance, tiredness,
all conspire to keep us running in circles.
Especially, right before setting off on an adventure,
sometimes it takes up to a week, to remember who we are.
First couple of days, are the worst,
it feels like adventure is not worth it, and we need to go back.
Back to what?
And how many years has it been now?
Adventure is a cute upside-down word,
hoping to remind you that you are full of energy and sunshine.
That you are a professional troublemaker,
and a fancy bookworm.
As good as your poker face is, under stress,
Ohh, the sh*tstorm that you will sow and reap, with your beautiful and perfect deadpan comedy,
upon an unsuspecting fellow shopper, whilst waiting in the checkout line at the local Supermarket.
They won&apos;t *ever* know what hit them, and you will uncontrollably giggle all the way back to your car,
whilst crunching the ice cream with sprinkles you just bought, with a whole new level of joy.
Nevermind, that for the first time in your life you own a phat marker,
and you started tagging the toilets with your incredible and edgy wit.
You&apos;ll get it under control,
I know you will.
There is just a couple of little problems that we do need to talk about...
(and this does not apply to all, just a couple of my readers)
Firstly, stop answering kind greetings &quot;Oh, hey, how are you?&quot; with,
&quot;Still Here&quot; - honestly, we know, we&apos;ve noticed, we just want to known how you are doing this?
And then telling people that you are, or used to be, or whatever: a Firefighter - must stop,
honestly, most people already assumed - that you used you volunteer - to put out hot fires.
Your multiple fanny packs, that&apos;s on point, everybody knows that all the great superheroes,
from Dwayne The Rock Goddamn Johnson to Tomb Raider and Freaky Batman, root and toot for you.
Now, this poem would be incomplete if I didn&apos;t ask you to get up right now,
and stretch a leg or two, a bit, and lookup Nurnberg Trailhead at W Nurnberg Rd, Free Soil, MI 49411.
Or any other tiny Wilderness that&apos;s not too near, not too far,
and spend the afternoon picking out a backpack, a fancy little tent...
The fluffiest sleeping bag you can find,
and one of those fancy inflatable pillows that will make you pass right out.
Grab a box of matches, the biggest, baddest Overkill Rambo knife you can find,
a water bottle, peanut butter wonder bread, a confusing compass and a load of sausages.
And go, don&apos;t delay, if the northern hemisphere is cold,
head on south, if south is cranky, head on north.
You are not supposed live to work,
you are only supposed to work just enough, to live so that you can Read and Listen to Books, and Grow.
Every day is the first day of the rest of your life,
and young or old, every day is a beautiful gift.
And there is no such thing as old age,
that&apos;s just a boogie man that the cowards made up
(If they can&apos;t become a great adventurer, why should anybody else)
Old age is a privilege, denied to many.
People that care about you want you to be Healthy, and Mighty,
they want you to be an Inspiration, that will forever inspire them to, Greatness.
Do not let a day go by...
And gol dang it, you&apos;re a Warrior.
Get two Rambo knives, the one on the left for sausages.
The one on the right, for throwing...
and for chopping Wood, and Moose, and Beaver
- that are so foolish as to wonder into your beautiful campsite.
Eat them,
or Curse Them!
But whatever you do,
get moving right now.
Due north, due south,
whichever is more welcoming.
Go.
Gooooolly, Go.

                  <span class="text-muted">Schools and Teachers, Universities, Colleges, and Professors, and even Politicians,
all had an amazing opportunity to enable the current generations with Real Education.
They will keep saying that they are working on it, and that they love students,
but then they will get confused and put politics first, creating that Hollow Feeling again.
You know what, they have ran out of time,
this is a big century for Human Kind.
We started out on the wrong foot,
we doubled the total of fossil fuel emissions in the last 25 years.
When Al Gore was working on his book,
he was writing in a world that had half the atmospheric emission we do.
You see, we are the leaders now, the intellectuals, the poets, the artists,
the people who failed to stop that doubling have retired or passed away.
If we were to ask them what they did it,
they could only say &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;
No blame, no accountability,
the change is so slow that the men who were destroying the world are gone.
The next 80 years is really important,
we can&apos;t afford to test if perhaps fake education will work out for us if we cram.
It maybe time, to temporarily push away from the promise of a diploma and a job,
and catch up with what has been going on in the world.
Reading and listening to real books is important,
taking responsibility for our own education, is very important.
You get to pick your Audio Books, your own Lecture Videos,
watch Documentaries about Climate and Nature, maybe Politics.
Keep a journal, do a book review,
for every Audio Book and Documentary you like.
And get out there, go camping, and adventuring.
Maybe even section hike the Appalachian Trail, or the Pacific Crest Trail,
or El Camino de Santiago and Kom-Emine, with your friends and parents.
Let the sunrise tell you when it is time to study,
let the sunset help you to sleep.
A lot that was lost in translation during standardized education,
can be pretty quickly regained, with top non-fiction, as long as you make room for it.
So, let us consider taking a year off when we feel ready for books,
maybe before college, or before we transfer to a university.
The journal and corresponding hiking videos or book reviews,
will provide plenty of evidence that it was not a year that was merely lost.
It seems that our Elder Selves will not hold falling in love with books against us,
to the contrary, this maybe one of those things that they wish for.
