if it was easy somebody else would have done it already.
Next time you&apos;re in class, look at the back row,
one of them is a genius who does not believe in the world anymore, the rest need help, the sooner the better.
I know you can prevent them from fracturing,
I know you have it in you to save the world.
All around the world, liars stretch accepted patterns they hardly understand, like a bubble gum, and with perfect deniability,
there is no blame, there is no proof, there are no laws that could help here, nothing can be done to fix anything.
But also nothing that Humanity needs,
has been lost permanently.
The state of things as we see today,
can be prevented from re-occurring come next-generation by means of real education, and prevention of emergence of desperate creatures that become perfect liars.
The same goes for criminals,
the idea of stealing an ATM to become free comes from little more than Saturday morning cartoons and desperation.
With real politics and wise politicians, we will see Universal Basic Income come into reality,
and nobody is going to rob anything if they already have the money and live a life of Knowledge, Authenticity, and Dignity.
As unbelievable as it sounds, Prevention coupled with Real Education,
that guides people towards Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness, is where Humanity will find its future.
Once liars take to power, we can only wait for them to retire,
and while we are waiting we have to help children grow so that they will become the Great Beings that will may their place.</span>

you are more than the endless universe will ever be able to comprehend.
You can&apos;t just act like everyone else,

You are nothing-like the mix that fits all,

And you do underestimate yourself,
it will take you a lot of distance, to get to know who you are.
You can learn a lot about your height in the universe,
when an unexpected storm approaches, and all you have is a tent.
That big storm is not interested in you,
and you have to learn to get along with nature.
In the raw beauty of it all,
a good adventure book makes all the difference.
That unfiltered nature, thunder,
or snow, or hard rain, or even a beautiful breeze in the woods...
Ad a place where you can truly hear,
the words of a Philosopher or an Adventurer is something else.
All the Philosophers are asking us to examine life,
to be authentic, to walk our own trail and then keep pushing forward.
Because that is how they rose,,
that&apos;s what made them into great, unique and timeless beings.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">There is little to stop life&apos;s misfortunes from happening,
but we can learn to face them in great dignity.
All misfortunes can be conquered with wisdom,
the act of rising from misfortunes grants our life a greater meaning.
With what we learn we can spare others the same pains,
thusly making our own aches count for more.
If all we have, to deal with great challenges,
is a diploma and a career, than that will not be enough for us.
We need enough wisdom in our soul or the content of our character,
to become in-compressible, and unbreakable.
Life must go on, we must rise against all odds,
no evil, no meaningless suffering, no liar is to hold us down.
The most powerful part of us that drives all the rest,
is wisdom.
Wisdom is like a flower, and it grows within books,
whatever our challenge, great beings faced similar circumstance.
And so that their aches did not get lost,
they turned them into wisdom, and the only way to reliably share wisdom is books.
A well narrated book can give a person great strength in a very short time,
and when our soul hurts the most our mind becomes extremely receptive to wisdom.
It is best, I think, to read books, or listen to their narrated versions,
ahead of time.
Books also enhance our decision making,
so that we may avoid hopelessness altogether.
The only thing that can give us great trouble,
is not having access to well respected and meaningful books that change lives with wisdom.
Because then we will need to rebuild the path to greatness from zero,
and that may take decades if not more.
There is a problem with books because reading them is not the best way to inherit their wisdom,
the best way is to have them beautifully read to us.
Not only that but in order to hear the narrator well,
we need a healthy mind and a balanced existence, a kind of a long and hard vacation.
We need the healing power of nature, of hills, trees, moss and fern,
little woodland springs, an occasional beach, warm nights and fragrant mornings.
To understand a book, you need a fine narrator, and thick smell of pine trees,
a cracking bonfire or cabin fireplace, and the certainty of knowing that you have tomorrow for yourself as well.
We are unable to inherit knowledge from books when our life is stressful,
in stress the best we can do is temporary memorize.
But we have to appreciate the content of what is being said,
not merely the words themselves, but the birth and life of the idea behind them.
Learning requires the creation of a map or scaffold,
and that can only be built when we love ourselves.
And once wisdom finally takes root within us, it cannot be removed in any way, wisdom grows, almost on its own,
it grants us solutions to new problems by subtle analogy to that which we already understand.
And wisdom spreads, it is hard not to share good ideas,
and it is hard to stop them from being shared.
Once equipped with wisdom,
we can hear the chains of misfortune dragging a mile away, and we are, in a way, ready.
We stand with the many others that we met in books, but now creating a family in time and space,
and now we fully appreciate their struggles and eventual triumph, and them taking the time to share their hard won wisdom.
And then we rise, we rise out of it all,
in our struggle wisdom will bloom within us multiplying our strengths to no end.
Later in life we will be able to heal others,
help them with their thoughts and towards their own synthesis of wisdom, and helping them to become just as unbreakable.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Life is not meant to frighten you,
it is meant to become your most Beautiful Work Of Art.
Even if we had perfect governments and perfect schools,
and became perfectly educated...
...it would still be better for us all, and the universe,
if you stopped following and begun leading to become the Best You.
Yeah, I guess you can&apos;t be a Doctor then,
but being a Doctor is not as lasting as becoming a Great Being.
A great being can heal entire generations,
reminding them of vision, wisdom, and of importance of an examined life.
Very few professionals can go that far out of their way,
and we all need help with Heart, or Fear, or Answers, and the Art of Existence.
A career will not help you make sense of life,
and there will be many challenges as we progress on.
Is it really that foolish to say that Wisdom should come first,
that we should get a solid grasp on things before setting aims?
I suppose that wisdom takes a relay long time,
but that&apos;s not a good reason to make it second to aims we set in High School.
We all agree that we should all be judged based on the content of our character,
and Knowledge and Wisdom is a pretty good way to make it Beautiful.
And things like Fear, Loneliness, or Sorrow cannot be helped by a career,
no matter how well it pays - being Human always comes first.
Only knowledge and the many components of wisdom contained within us
can help us rise to the great many challenges of life.
Learning to become Knowledgeable and Wise is so wonderful,
we just take our audio books on long winding nature trails, and sandy beaches.
We bring our graphite and drawing notepads, even canvas, acrylics and oils,
and all the questions, that we struggle finding answers to in the midst of haste.
And we learn, on beautiful evenings thick with oxygen, and energizing mornings rich with crisp cool air,
so as long as we have access to books that help us inherit wisdom from countless other lives, so that we need not start at zero - we learn.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">It is not always necessary to accurately map the affairs of the World.
sometimes all you need is a vision of a better one.
The world is difficult to grasp because people in authority,
have interests that differ from, the people that vote on them.
Furthermore, low quality schools,
will prevent the voter from making correct choices.
The uneducated or misled majority,
will always be incorrect.
This is why independent, self education,
be it in addition or as a replacement of the national one is a wise idea.
Independent education is one that is paved with curiosities,
and helped along with top-selling non fiction, including narrated books.
Majority of world&apos;s top selling books
are written by well educated and well meaning authors.
Lack of education breeds desperation,
not only will the voters be confused, but the politicians won&apos;t understand them either.
A world where leaders place their needs above the people they swore to represent,
and do the bare minimum for maximum personal gains, is a world that needs vision.
On the other hand, a well educated, knowledgeable and wise voting majority,
isn&apos;t one to get confused, or become mislead, easily.
A vision is always something that most of humanity has already agreed on,
though they might have forgotten parts here and there, or worded them differently.
For example:
Climate Stabilization
Human Dignity
World Peace
Universal Human Rights
World Disarmament
Functional Education
End Of Poverty All Around The World
Universal Basic Income
World Unity
Justice
Authenticity, and Truth.
As we progress from well-read, to knowledgeable, to wise, and onward to our greatness,
we will collect and hold in our hearts many such Hopes and Dreams.
At first they may seem like words or beautiful ideas,
but as we look into Memoirs, and beloved and honored works of great story tellers, they will become more.
With a few dozen books a concept that has been lost on leaders of humanity,
will come to life in our hearts.
Rather than trying to flawlessly comprehend the world,
which may not be possible due to too many liars who by definition lack in vision, and are merely responding to stimuli for maximum self gain.
We gain the ability hold up several of our most beloved Aims, Hopes and Dreams,
and ask what are the leaders doing to fulfill them.
It is much easier to look at a leader&apos;s sum of history,
and notice that they have never done anything meaningful for World Peace and Elimination of Poverty, than to await their promises to come true.
We can then ask, if we want to vote on people who do not recognize World Peace and Elimination of Poverty as an aim,
and what those people must be like.
More importantly, holding a meaningful vision helps us grow up stronger and faster,
helps us focus our energies and curiosities on things that we become passionate about.
When a wise voting majority becomes passionate about Human Dignity,
the strength that arises from Unity of Vision can easily repair World&apos;s Nations and help Humanity Grow.
Without a wise consensus things that are concurring around the world are probably mostly random,
with elections won by those who spend most money on taking on a pleasing shape, and disasters being a predictable result of corruption and shortsightedness.
It is hard to blame leaders and voters for something as disabling as lack of education,
people who lack knowledge pave their ways with their best intentions, alas Humanity&apos;s most beloved works of non-fiction must come first, lest we continue repeating the same old mistakes.
There is nothing difficult
about falling in love with Good Ideas,
When we take to Adventures and Books, and a new book surprises us with a like selection of Hopes and Dreams,
we can only discover how connected we all really are, that we are in fact one big family.
What are your Hopes and Dreams?
What is your Vision of The Future Of Humanity?</span>
