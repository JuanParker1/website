                    </header>
                    <p>She likley stole her daddy&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s password by using her older brother&#x2019;s
                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/keylogger/s?k=keylogger">key logger</a>. To log into her dad&#x2019;s computer she uses the ssh command.
                      ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection
                      between two computers. She executes ssh alex@192.168.1.27 at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=87">1:27</a>. And
                      begins using the ssh program.
                    </p>
                    <p>The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her own
                      local shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in a
                      full-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell prompt
                      changes to that of the remote system. It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to
                      []~$[].</p>
                    <p>A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type
                      commands. Her dad&#x2019;s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was
                      supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using
                      fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My
                      prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is
                      user, my computer&#x2019;s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is
                      warrior.</p>
                    <p>The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can
                      escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you
                      can read or delete other user&#x2019;s files. On most systems the dollar sign
                      would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken
                      as you are in special privileges mode, often called <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/root.html">root</a>.</p>

                      <h2>Warning</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad&#x2019;s computer she makes it
                      talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</p>
                    <p>A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a
                      management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but
                      it is OK to call it that.</p>
                    <p>The say command uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">speech synthesis</a> to convert text to speech. The
                      say command resides on her dad&#x2019;s computer, and thus uses her dad&#x2019;s speaker.
                      She executes the command at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310">5:10</a></p>
                    <p>The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</p>
                    <p><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></p>
                    <p>You see that -v that&#x2019;s a special directive that states when executing the
                      say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of
                      sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</p>
                    <p>How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena
                      is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person
                      executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is
                      called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that
                      they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the
                      manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can
                      list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do
                      multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet
                      version of a man page for say: <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/say.html">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p>
                    <p>People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,
                      here is one example <a href="https://tldr.sh/">https://tldr.sh/</a> but it is always best to go to
                      the source, and just get used to the man command.</p>
                    <p>She didn&#x2019;t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just
                      executed:</p>
                    <p><strong>say dad watch out</strong></p>
                    <p>And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly
                      available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.</p>
                    <p><strong>espeak &quot;dad watch out&quot;</strong></p>
                    <p>Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple
                      words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A
                      programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak
                      simply said &#x201C;I am not just going to read everything that you type at me&#x201D;
                      whereas the programmer that made the say command said &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just assume
                      that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless
                      something starts with a hyphen&#x201D;. The say command makes assumptions, whereas
                      espeak is very strict about input.</p>

                    <p>At <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229">3:49</a> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down
                      her dad&#x2019;s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac
                      users frequently use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> code editor. She issues the kill
                      command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically
                      crashes her dad&#x2019;s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save
                      data. Here is the man page for the kill command
                      <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill">https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill</a>. Unix programs that are actively
                      running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)
                      and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during

                      to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad
                      enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]
                      signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and
                      then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his
                      data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is
                      no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is
                      destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She

                      jargon file you can read at

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>What Is a Hacker?</strong></p>
                    <p>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and
                      networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the
                      first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The
                      members of this culture originated the term &#x2018;hacker&#x2019;. Hackers built the
                      Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers
                      make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have
                      contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a
                      hacker, you&#x2019;re a hacker.</p>
                    <p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There
                      are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics
                      or music &#x2014; actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science
                      or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may
                      call them &#x2018;hackers&#x2019; too &#x2014; and some claim that the hacker nature is really
                      independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</p>
                    <p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but
                      aren&apos;t. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who
                      get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.
                      Real hackers call these people &#x2018;crackers&#x2019; and want nothing to do with them.
                      Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very
                      bright, and object that being able to break security doesn&apos;t make you a
                      hacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotive
                      engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into
                      using the word &#x2018;hacker&#x2019; to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers
                      no end.</p>
                    <p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.&#x201D;</p>

And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished. The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen. We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses. Nietzsche Viktor Frankl State of Mind INVICTUS - W. E. Henley Francine&apos;s Interview </span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
