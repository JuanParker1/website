                <p>to cut a broad swath and shave close,</p>
                <p>to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&quot;</p>

                <p>as part of learning English and good film making, I remembered:</p>

              <section>
                <p>Ferris Bueller saying &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&apos;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;,</p>

                <p>the generosity that responds to their cries of despair</p>

                <p>The book I have read the most times is &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; by Bill Bryson,</p>
                <p>it is a book that begins with an honest journey to find out more about the world.</p>

                <p>It is very helpful to realize that we don&apos;t know all the things we should know,</p>
                <p>and not be ashamed of that, just simply look for some Audio Books on the subject.</p>

                <p>I write this in 2020 in the middle of the Pandemic,</p>

                <p>In my memory Carl Sagan in his &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;</p>
                <p>mentions something similar on the subject of Aliens and UFOs.</p>

                <p>He says that there is more beauty and interesting things in the actual Science,</p>

                <p>When I was a teenager I was a huge fan of shows like the X-Files,</p>
                <p>and I remember walking into a mighty New York Public Library to crack the case, once and fall all,</p>

                <p>Nut instead falling in love with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe">Mokele-mbembe</a>, I recognized the creature from my first Science book &quot;Wszech&#x15B;wiat &#x17C;ycie cz&#x142;owiek&quot; published in 1955,</p>
                <p>it was a Brontosaurus, and I instantly fell in love with the idea there there might be a few left in Rhodesia.</p>
