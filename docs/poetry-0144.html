                    <p>to cut a broad swath and shave close,</p>

                    <p>Ferris Bueller saying &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&apos;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Greatness is not a question of having it or not,
it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.
We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,
to save the world from mediocrity and hate.
All battles for goodness are already won,
and before you know it, your great task will be done.
But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,
set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.
You never really fight in a good war,
the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.
But Greatness will call to you non the less,
it will ask you to speak about Wisdom, Love, Growing Up, and Kindness.
You see many Great Beings smile when facing wrath,
that powerful joy comes from the certainty of walking the right path.
Those who walk the wrong path, age quickly and fade,
and history books will soon-enough reveal their charade.
The Noble Greatness within us all is forged to last,
and the opportunities ahead are as beautiful as vast.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Any adventure,
is an adventure.
You don&apos;t have to go far,
though walking will be involved.
Adventures within adventures,
are even more fun.
That&apos;s where you go somewhere,
and then explore something else from there.
It is like going to Ludington,
but then marching around Nordhouse Dunes.
Or visiting White Fish Point,
and then trying to find fossils on the beach.
Or even going to the mall with your friends,
and then just people watching instead.
One definition of tiny adventures,
is going somewhere and then learning something new.
But you see, in this modern age we live in now,
this is a lot more exciting than it sounds, because of Audio Books.
Though you maybe walking to the store for a change,
your Audio Book, may transport you to the Appalachian Trail.
There are other things that can spice up your adventures,
it all depends how creative you are.
For example, back in January 2014,
during the gorgeous -16 Fahrenheit Polar Vortex weather in Michigan.
With all the warnings as not to go outside,
and stay home, and drink hot chocolate.
I put on all my clothes, all at once,
and hurried out, for an hour-and-a-half-long expedition.
I wasn&apos;t in want for anything,
so I figured I might as well get some little beef jerky sausages.
It didn&apos;t seem as cold as everyone made it out to be,
but it did make my sausages; as frosty, as my little adventure fantastic.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Time for all of us to rise,
to fuel that which is greatest within us.
It is how we change the world with our works,
that matters the most in the end.
It is almost certainly a very small book,
one that will sit along side a smartphone.
And it is a book of answers,
that helps the children to real life.
Let us open our books
by undoing burdens:
&quot;Whatever trouble brought you to my book, child,
know that there are few people
that would have acted differently
in circumstances similar to yours.&quot;
And then carefully, let us share,
in the limited number of pages that we have,
what has moved us the most.
Without our hard earned wisdom,
they don&apos;t really have a chance at not making the same mistakes.
Who else is going to teach them if not us,
what Socrates said was only meant for the age he grew up in.
We need to repeat it anew,
nearer the culture of the children.
We have to help them understand,
that old age is a privileged denied to many.
So as long as we take to living in pursuit if wisdom,
and it is never to late to start, aging is a good thing.
Let us not have the children start at the same height we stated,
let us spare them the aches we went through, may our aches count for more.
Let us show the younger generations that we are rising,
that we are building a better world albeit slowly.
The world can&apos;t be replaced,
it must be transformed.
Just like a ship can&apos;t be replaced,
but can be transformed by updating it, board by board.
Let us show them that part of the meaning of their existence,
is a lasting legacy of wisdom.
The sooner they start,
the more beautiful their rise.
And the other part is Happiness,
out of Wisdom, out of Strength.
The meaning of life comes with Wisdom,
as our mind becomes more powerful for all the good ideas it gathers.
We have to help the children to understand,
that they belong to a Universal Culture, that they are Citizens of the World.
That all the things that change based on geographic location,
are but traditions.
Only that which remains regardless of where they are born,
is their true culture.
We have to get them to help each other as they grow,
to reach out to each other across borders.
The borders that dive us,
borders are just the products of small and primitive minds.
The future belongs to the children,
not those who gained authority by pretending.
There is hope for a more just and transparent world,
but it requires that we all stand in relentless pursuit of wisdom.
A liar will always win,
except when it comes to the wise
The wise will easily recognize the uneducated fool,
taking on his pleasing shapes.
Let us help the younger generations, to wisdom,
by telling them about Philosophers and their Love and Pursuit of Wisdom.
Let us pass on only the good ideas,
and commit the bad ones to history books as cautionary tales.
A life is a work of art, it paints it self day by day,
to create a beautiful picture, our legacy.
Life is best lived when what we learned yesterday,
adds to help us become a little bit wiser today.
The energy and the force for it all comes from
from watching our contributions help the world grow.
The new generations starting, not at zero,
but at the heights that we bought them to, by our own deliberate pursuit of wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">A hole in the window curtain,
lets a stray ray of light in.
The light displays a blurry image,
of what is outside, a pin hole camera.
As the beam travels along the wall,
he can imagine the entire solar system.
He knows the planet spins and rotates,
by inference from Jupiter Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
And now slowly the light,
reaches an old crystal vase.
There is a rainbow,
the beam of light is unfurled.
He&apos;s counting the colors,
and a violin plays.
And A becomes Blue,
B is Indigo,
C turns Violet,
D is Red,
E becomes Orange,
F is Yellow,
and G glows Green.
He watched the whole thing,
in bed, in silence.
He knows now he will turn led to gold,
let the Clockwork Universe, Unfold.
You are so lucky that you live in an age where you can pull up,
Newton&apos;s book on opticks with the click of a link.
In most cases you can&apos;t be stopped by by research you have not yet conducted,
and you don&apos;t have to invent much from scratch, you just need a science book.
You have the same mental powers as Newton and all the others,
but you DO, have to slow down, and think about things just like they did.
Learning or catching up,
is an Art.
Even though you have all the answers before you,
you can&apos;t read it all at once.
You have to follow one thread at a time,
our minds need time to comprehend and rearrange.
Like the body of a dancer needs time to adapt,
we have to learn at a precise pace, and sequence.
It is very similar to learning the roads of a new city,
you never say to your self I am not smart enough to navigate.
Because you never listen to confusing directions,
you just follow a single road at your own pace and eventually master it.
See, Newton learned from works of Galileo,
who passed away the year Newton was born.
And although Newton never did convert led to gold,
the led of his pencil, became even more precious.
Many of Newton&apos;s works,
must have fascinated Henry Cavendish.
And Einstein no doubt appreciated the modes of thinking these men revealed,
even though he never figured out his Spooky Action at a Distance.
They all learned much along the way,
and each became wise for trying.

                  <span class="text-muted">It is quite a quirk we have,
that we believe whatever we are born into.
It is such a terrible disadvantage,
and nobody, makes it known to us.
The study of Cognitive Biases,
should be first and foremost.
I wish teachers would speak out more often,
instead they are just pushing everyone through.
For one they get to keep their jobs,
and two, it is not their job to fix education.
It takes so little, to start learning on your own,
and it makes such an enormous difference.
Life becomes so long, and so cheerful,
and you can feel your self growing up.
Book by book, curiosity by curiosity,
all the dots connect.
And they will only connect,
if you are learning what you like or love.
If someone is making those selections for you,
then it is all just going to be disconnected noise.
At a young age it is all to easy to say,
education is not for me.
Similar thing happens in Academic Philosophy,
people simply say &quot;Philosophy is useless for life&quot;.
&quot;Academic Philosophy,
has no relevance.&quot;
Philo-sophia means Love of Wisdom,
but when it it taken into Academia...
When it is divided into subjects,
it loses everything, it becomes synthetic, and useless.
That&apos;s how you should view Education divided into subjects,
synthetic, and useless.
Real education is the thing that Great Beings granted themselves,
before standardized schooling became mandatory and cut up.
Build your own school,
book by book, adventure by adventure, curiosity by curiosity.
You have a powerful mind,
the constellation of stars within, is perfectly unique.
You are irreplaceable,
in every way.
Don&apos;t trust anybody to teach you anything,
just make your way towards books that move you.
In this modern age,
books are read to you, by professional narrators.
So as long as you slow down to give them a chance, you can learn,
from the Proudest Works, of the Greatest Minds, in the best of ways.
Teachers only care about the moment they are in,
but your life, will be long.
Your life will carry on,
long after school.
You need real education,
one that leads to real wisdom.
We can&apos;t go through life,
filled with disconnected knowledge that can&apos;t connect.
We need a self-reinforcing, integrated library,
of all the modern works.
You can only get that from modern non-fiction, or popular science books,
and especially when authors reference or thank each other.
A popular science book is a story about the science,
about the things that made it come into being.
Facts are the least that thy take away from it,
it is the stories of adventure, and modes of thinking that matter most.
Our search for wisdom must come first,
or we won&apos;t be able to tell real from fake.
Wisdom is fundamental to our decision making,
clarity of vision, is too important to trust others with.
It shouldn&apos;t matter where to to whom we are born,
there is just one reality.</span>
