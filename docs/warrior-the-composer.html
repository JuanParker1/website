                    <p>You don&apos;t need to know musical notation.</p>
                    <p>Musical notation has been replaced by a SAVE BUTTON.</p>
                    <p>No, you do not need to know Musical Notation to read Chopin&apos;s Nocturnes,
                      either.</p>
                    <p>You just import the midi file into lmms, and gaze. He is not smarter than
                      you, he just sat at a piano making melodies, wrote them down arranged them
                      in a song, and became famous for having picked nice ones.</p>
                    <p>(Don&apos;t listen to people telling you that you can&apos;t become a World Famous
                      Maestro, because you don&apos;t know notes. They are just salty because they had
                      to learn them, and you don&apos;t.)</p>
                    <p>Like languages, music evolved to match our abilities. Everyone is a
                      composer. The rules are very simple.</p>
                    <p>Drums must be low and simple one or two keys. When making melodies don&apos;t
                      jump around, transition from one nearby key to another, they are grouped to
                      sound nice together. Break the rules from time to time.</p>

                      <h2>Melody &amp; Song Structure</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Look how keys go together, only when melody gets too boring, is there a
                      huge shift, a kind of a bridge, to get you to the next melody.</p>
                    <p>Notice the Intro, the song does not really start until Ralph Wiggum ends up
                      wearing Jebediah Springfield&apos;s Head as a hat.</p>
                    <p>Look how the song has quick melodies, followed by longer key presses, and
                      quick little melodies again. This way none of the parts get boring, and the
                      song keeps going.</p>
                    <p>Notice the Outro. The moment Matt Groening name is displayed, a new
                      variation pops up, and it is a melody that has a very nice closure at the
                      end. It does not seem to leave off unfinished, it hits those four final
                      notes in a sequence, and you know it is done, and done.</p>

                    <p>Drums do beat.</p>
                    <p>Beat is what your foot does when you like a song. There will be a rhythm
                      within a song almost always represented by a drum kit. A low deep sound
                      with some stuff happening behind it. That stuff behind it is the drum kit.</p>
                    <p>Listen, The Drum Kit, is just an instrument. If it was just the drums, it
                      would be like a piano with one key. There is more to drums, there are some
                      quick sharp sounding things that go along with it.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>It hurts my heart to say this lovely woman is doing something wrong.</p>
                    <p>As a Professional Pianist, she is brilliant, but as a teacher, she is a
                      Destroyer of Hopes.</p>
                    <p>Don&apos;t listen to a word she says.</p>
                    <p>Watch her hands.</p>
                    <p>She is using both of them.</p>
                    <p>Her left hand is creating low-frequency sounds, and she almost never does
                      anything there, and she keeps things simple. She is almost doing drums with
                      her left hand, she is laying down the beat.</p>
                    <p>Ignore her left hand, now.</p>
                    <p>Look at her right hand, at first she goes up and down. Then she does the
                      pinky &amp; thumb, but still, even though she is playing notes apart, see it as
                      one note, pay attention to thumb only. She does jump between keys, but it
                      is rare and masked by her left hand that is doing the beat.</p>
                    <p>The keys she presses at the same time with her right hand should be seen as
                      one key, she is just mixing two sounds together to create a third sound.
                      When she presses two keys at the same time, she is adding a third key.</p>
                    <p>Why add keys to the piano. Because two keys at the same time sounds richer
                      than pressing one key.</p>
                    <p>Making a single sound out of pressing multiple keys at the same time, is
                      called making a chord. Chords are multiple notes played at the same time,
                      for the purpose of enriching the complexity of what you hear.</p>
                    <p>Left hand does the simple beat, it must always be simple.</p>
                    <p>Right hand does the melody, slowly goes up and down, in this particular
                      video chords aside, she only skips one key to get to the next note.</p>
                    <p>All of this is obscured, because she was taught Music Theory compatible
                      with Mozart &amp; Chopin.</p>
                    <p>You are being taught to break out. Chords are beautiful for sure, but, you
                      just use the recording (the sound sample a .wav/mp3 of the chord) and focus

                    <p>There are many theories.</p>
                    <p>Newton, went as far as saying that he made Calculus more complicated than
                      it should be, on purpose.</p>
                    <p>Chopin, would never dare to simplify his work.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett: English political leader, activist, writer and feminist icon. Known as a campaigner for women&apos;s suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until 1919 she led Britain&apos;s largest women&apos;s rights organisation, the National Union of Women&apos;s Suffrage Societies. The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.: Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop, and often block traffic. If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want to do their job, go home, and get paid. If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job and go watch some TV. You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&apos;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot; and you&apos;ll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you&apos;ll struggle to remember where it all started and what the battle was for. Because The Battle Is Not For You: The battle is for those that come; after you. In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the same. In long term, you help the world grow, it won&apos;t be your world, it will be the world of the future. The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education are two separate things. It will make you tired. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood. Bad News: There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too low. Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education, the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot; grades, making your parents happy. Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never looking back. Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue. Henry David Thoreau: I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms... The Good News: Real Education, is not about getting really educated. It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health. Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is not a healthy life. Faith of the Heart Article One: Inherent Dignity, Nobility.: The first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility. No one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or vacation, or else. You are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you are to rage, to rage against the dying of the light. Self Education starts With Life Changing Books: Best way to understand a book, is to listen to the Author reading it. And the best way to listen to a book, is while climbing a great mountain.
