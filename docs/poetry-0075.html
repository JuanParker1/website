                  <span class="text-muted">We are each a miracle of Cosmos,
and each day is a gift.
Life is not short, life is so long,
that you are going to forget a bunch a stuff, and not care.
But it is possible to run in circles;
pretend to learn, work hard at a job you hate, and never really grow up.
It is easy to avoid this,
we just need to listen to some deeply fascinating and inspiring audio books on a long, beautiful and healthy adventure.
But also, we can&apos;t really return from the adventure,
we have to continue climbing at the same of better angle that the adventure pushed us into.
That is what growing is,
we never go back to little things, we always go forward to the greater things.
For example, the moment I help yo understand that school is robbing you of creativity,
that cramming and memorizing is just acting and not learning, you have to aim higher, and learn for real.
You can go back to school,
but you can only treat it as a game.
Know that you are not getting an education, and the curricula are going to be all over the place, and you&apos;ll just spin in circles merely exercising your temporary memory,
you are unlikely to be inheriting knowledge and components of wisdom from great beings, onward to becoming wise, and eventually speaking out as a Great Being.
School is not going to teach you that,
you will still need a real education.
And although life is very long,
it is still worrisome that someone should sink several years towards an unknown, a goal set in childhood.
Charles Bukowski, who does not mince words, asks this terrible question,
about the morning routine - and I quote:
&quot;How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock,
leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, s*it, p*ss, brush teeth and hair,
and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?&quot;
Furthermore, Henry Thoreau, or Socrates reminds us,
that we need to know what life is, and the following quote is from Walden.
&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life,
and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;
nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.
I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,
to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,
to cut a broad swath and shave close,
to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&quot;
These are great beings, they are immortal, full of wisdom and knowledge,
it is really important to - if not befriend them - then to at least answer their questions.
Like I said, life is so long that you are going to forget a bunch of years,
and not even feel bad about it.
But lowering ourselves into a decades long routine,
that we may kind of regret later on, is not good.
While life is long,
we don&apos;t get a do over, so we have to make sure that we are headed towards a good and healthy future, an authentic future.
All I am saying, is that you must carefully examine life,
because there are too many people out there that will try to take advantage of your inexperience.
By examining life, by listening to great beings with large libraries of experiences, mistakes, failures and triumphs,
you will learn from their life, and get a really good idea of where you really want to be.
And more than that,
you can take multiple paths.
For example become a writer and a poet, first; and then go back to Med School after you crossed the Appalachian Trail a couple of times,
and after you fought some Angry Bears and Mountain Lions with little more than Courage and some sharp Nail Clippers.</span>

if it was easy somebody else would have done it already.
Next time you&apos;re in class, look at the back row,
one of them is a genius who does not believe in the world anymore, the rest need help, the sooner the better.
I know you can prevent them from fracturing,
I know you have it in you to save the world.
All around the world, liars stretch accepted patterns they hardly understand, like a bubble gum, and with perfect deniability,
there is no blame, there is no proof, there are no laws that could help here, nothing can be done to fix anything.
But also nothing that Humanity needs,
has been lost permanently.
The state of things as we see today,
can be prevented from re-occurring come next-generation by means of real education, and prevention of emergence of desperate creatures that become perfect liars.
The same goes for criminals,
the idea of stealing an ATM to become free comes from little more than Saturday morning cartoons and desperation.
With real politics and wise politicians, we will see Universal Basic Income come into reality,
and nobody is going to rob anything if they already have the money and live a life of Knowledge, Authenticity, and Dignity.
As unbelievable as it sounds, Prevention coupled with Real Education,
that guides people towards Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness, is where Humanity will find its future.
Once liars take to power, we can only wait for them to retire,
and while we are waiting we have to help children grow so that they will become the Great Beings that will may their place.</span>

you are more than the endless universe will ever be able to comprehend.

And you do underestimate yourself,
it will take you a lot of distance, to get to know who you are.
You can learn a lot about your height in the universe,
when an unexpected storm approaches, and all you have is a tent.
That big storm is not interested in you,
and you have to learn to get along with nature.
In the raw beauty of it all,
a good adventure book makes all the difference.
That unfiltered nature, thunder,
or snow, or hard rain, or even a beautiful breeze in the woods...
Ad a place where you can truly hear,
the words of a Philosopher or an Adventurer is something else.
All the Philosophers are asking us to examine life,
to be authentic, to walk our own trail and then keep pushing forward.
Because that is how they rose,,
that&apos;s what made them into great, unique and timeless beings.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">There is little to stop life&apos;s misfortunes from happening,
but we can learn to face them in great dignity.
All misfortunes can be conquered with wisdom,
the act of rising from misfortunes grants our life a greater meaning.
With what we learn we can spare others the same pains,
thusly making our own aches count for more.
If all we have, to deal with great challenges,
is a diploma and a career, than that will not be enough for us.
We need enough wisdom in our soul or the content of our character,
to become in-compressible, and unbreakable.
Life must go on, we must rise against all odds,
no evil, no meaningless suffering, no liar is to hold us down.
The most powerful part of us that drives all the rest,
is wisdom.
Wisdom is like a flower, and it grows within books,
whatever our challenge, great beings faced similar circumstance.
And so that their aches did not get lost,
they turned them into wisdom, and the only way to reliably share wisdom is books.
A well narrated book can give a person great strength in a very short time,
and when our soul hurts the most our mind becomes extremely receptive to wisdom.
It is best, I think, to read books, or listen to their narrated versions,
ahead of time.
Books also enhance our decision making,
so that we may avoid hopelessness altogether.
The only thing that can give us great trouble,
is not having access to well respected and meaningful books that change lives with wisdom.
Because then we will need to rebuild the path to greatness from zero,
and that may take decades if not more.
There is a problem with books because reading them is not the best way to inherit their wisdom,
the best way is to have them beautifully read to us.
Not only that but in order to hear the narrator well,
we need a healthy mind and a balanced existence, a kind of a long and hard vacation.
We need the healing power of nature, of hills, trees, moss and fern,
little woodland springs, an occasional beach, warm nights and fragrant mornings.
To understand a book, you need a fine narrator, and thick smell of pine trees,
a cracking bonfire or cabin fireplace, and the certainty of knowing that you have tomorrow for yourself as well.
We are unable to inherit knowledge from books when our life is stressful,
in stress the best we can do is temporary memorize.
But we have to appreciate the content of what is being said,
not merely the words themselves, but the birth and life of the idea behind them.
Learning requires the creation of a map or scaffold,
and that can only be built when we love ourselves.
And once wisdom finally takes root within us, it cannot be removed in any way, wisdom grows, almost on its own,
it grants us solutions to new problems by subtle analogy to that which we already understand.
And wisdom spreads, it is hard not to share good ideas,
and it is hard to stop them from being shared.
Once equipped with wisdom,
we can hear the chains of misfortune dragging a mile away, and we are, in a way, ready.
We stand with the many others that we met in books, but now creating a family in time and space,
and now we fully appreciate their struggles and eventual triumph, and them taking the time to share their hard won wisdom.
And then we rise, we rise out of it all,
in our struggle wisdom will bloom within us multiplying our strengths to no end.
Later in life we will be able to heal others,
help them with their thoughts and towards their own synthesis of wisdom, and helping them to become just as unbreakable.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Life is not meant to frighten you,
it is meant to become your most Beautiful Work Of Art.
Even if we had perfect governments and perfect schools,
and became perfectly educated...
...it would still be better for us all, and the universe,
if you stopped following and begun leading to become the Best You.
Yeah, I guess you can&apos;t be a Doctor then,
but being a Doctor is not as lasting as becoming a Great Being.
A great being can heal entire generations,
reminding them of vision, wisdom, and of importance of an examined life.
Very few professionals can go that far out of their way,
and we all need help with Heart, or Fear, or Answers, and the Art of Existence.
A career will not help you make sense of life,
and there will be many challenges as we progress on.
Is it really that foolish to say that Wisdom should come first,
that we should get a solid grasp on things before setting aims?
I suppose that wisdom takes a relay long time,
but that&apos;s not a good reason to make it second to aims we set in High School.
We all agree that we should all be judged based on the content of our character,
and Knowledge and Wisdom is a pretty good way to make it Beautiful.
And things like Fear, Loneliness, or Sorrow cannot be helped by a career,
no matter how well it pays - being Human always comes first.
Only knowledge and the many components of wisdom contained within us
can help us rise to the great many challenges of life.
Learning to become Knowledgeable and Wise is so wonderful,
we just take our audio books on long winding nature trails, and sandy beaches.
We bring our graphite and drawing notepads, even canvas, acrylics and oils,
and all the questions, that we struggle finding answers to in the midst of haste.
And we learn, on beautiful evenings thick with oxygen, and energizing mornings rich with crisp cool air,
so as long as we have access to books that help us inherit wisdom from countless other lives, so that we need not start at zero - we learn.</span>
