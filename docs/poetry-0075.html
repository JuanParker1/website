                <p>Well, from the first moment on,</p>
                <p>we are asked if we should live in harmony.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>We are still very young,</p>
                <p>barely know of the world.</p>
              </section>

              <section>

                <p>We forgot our Lego and the old bike,</p>

                <p>It was a key to unlock our mind,</p>

                <p>It was to remind us,</p>
