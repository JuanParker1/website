Each student will mark their own trail with their own curiosities,

Education will be life long,
lectures will be open and free.
There will be less potential for war,
Humanity will converge on the same body of good ideas.

                  <span class="text-muted">The simplest, most resilient, tested and lasting unit of information,
that can transfer large amounts of knowledge between Human Beings, is a book.
Reading a raw book is like eating soup from a can,
it is very nutritious, it tastes OK, it is fine, but there is a better way.
To improve a book we can use a capable narrator to read it, and record it,
creating an audio book that we can bring with us on an adventure.
For example, we can pack a day pack and go to a nearby State Park with long winding trails,
along the way we can relax, enjoy the season, the atmosphere, and learn.
Combining a Nature Walk with the Audio Book version,
reveals the original paper book for what it really is.
A paper book is about long term storage of ideas that can be archived for ages,
and enjoyed for hundreds if not thousands of years.
A book should be decoded from text to audio,
only then can we fully process the ideas that the author wants to share.
To back up this claim, think of a Business asking employees to read a particular book,
would it not be much better to help the employees to a day off an gift them a well narrated audio version?
A good book is more than just a thing to be read line by line,
a book not only contains ideas and tools for thinking but also the author at the time of writing.
To read a book for real, we really have to hear the author speak,
we have to be able to feel their Soul, Heart, and Spirit.
Should the author prove worthy we should become friends with them across space and time,
perhaps even make them part of our extended family and put their photo near or on the Fireplace Mantel.
A good book, is a book that makes us a better person by transferring some hard earned wisdom,
a kind of timeless love, that helps the world to become a wiser and better place.
Much of the World is still divided by imaginary borders,
the division relies on political, religious and cultural indoctrination presenting a subset of reality, if not warping it entirely.
Making wisdom more accessible, especially to young people who learn the fastest and are about to face challenges previously unseen,
is more than just a good idea, it is our moral duty.
I ask all the companies who hold the ability to release meaningful audio-books to students, to do so, right now,
we should not hope to make money by restricting or impeding access to knowledge,
not to the generation that now faces the problems we were unable to stop ourselves from propagating.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">My Friends,
In this letter I ask you to begin working on building the schools we wish we had,
by means of creating free and open audio and video lectures.
I am asking you to study what you love, to learn and master what moves your heart,
and improve and refine the notes and materials until the audio/video recordings can lead a lecture worthy of your students.
I am asking you to rise to the Great Challenge of becoming Real Teachers,
so that you may help the Younger Generations out of Love, and Inspiration, and Wisdom.
The problems of Mass Incarceration, Climate Change, and Voter Confusion,
are rooted in the broken systems of education that we see today.
By enabling the new generation of students,
we will help them with the challenges they will soon face.
We are going to replace schools and broken/fake education,
with the lectures we upload to the internet, together.
Wherever possible, work in groups,
so that no one Great Being must carry the weight of this Great Challenge alone.
I want you to work together, so that the students who will use your materials,
will fell your friendship and love, hear your laughter, your authenticity, and heroism.
Schools begun hurting the world by misleading children,
and pushing them into the false belief that they are not smart enough for good grades.
The truth is that all children are geniuses,
as Humans, we are all equally gifted.
However, we all too easily accept authority without question,
and all too easily fail to perceive reality warped by cultural indoctrination.
Let us begin our work, in the beginning,
starting where Elementary School ends and Middle School Begins.
This is the point where education becomes a charade of memorization, grades, and standardized testing,
this is where we divide Human Knowledge into categories that lose their meaning and purpose.
Let us build our lectures, baby step by baby step,
following simple human curiosity that lies behind so many of our greatest achievements.
The task at hand is simple,
but also enormous.
The more join us under the banner of Free and Open Lectures,
the easier the path to the Real Solutions and Real Results that the future generations require.
Let us build a school in the Public Domain,
a school that invites all to learn from Audio, Video and Digital Materials.
A school where there are no grades,
only visible paths and milestones of proud achievements and joy of learning.
Let us encourage all the participants to expand the lectures under no subject in particular,
simply what makes best sense for the Human Mind to Grasp.
Let us tile our lecture for what they really are,
and may they unite many of the old subjects, so that they may be once again be free of borders and overflowing with content.
The world of the future requires real solutions with lasting results to very complex problems,
let us help the children of today meet that challenge in Knowledge and Wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Just like we are vulnerable,
to listening to authority without question.
Just like we are blind to indoctrination,
unable to see fast enough that reality had been warped.
We also have a problem of integration with Knowledge and Wisdom,
if our days are too busy, stressful, too short, we won&apos;t be able to learn.
Ensuring that we live at a proper pace,
is part of taking care of our Mental and Intellectual Hygiene.
Our Mental Health is important,
we should never forget to take care of our minds.
The pace you live at can prevent you from learning,
so you have to live in balance, and in balance with time.
How do you know if you are out of balance?
- that is actually a very easy question to answer.
When you feel, like you need to &quot;go somewhere&quot; to think,
it means you are out of balance, and you need to re-prioritize matters in your life.
Thinking is critical to our well being,
not being able to think, is a sign of trouble.
Experiencing difficulty with thinking and having ideas,
means that we have to find a way to adjust our lifestyle.
Our minds are too powerful to try to shut them off,
we are all geniuses, extremely powerful thinkers, with infinite imaginations.
Past the point when we adjust to be able to enjoy storytelling,
we have to choose books that feed our soul, that make us laugh and wonder.
Our minds need storytelling for enriching our imagination,
a good book is always about some story being told.
Finally, don&apos;t let yourself be tricked by the appearance of books,
or the simplicity and convenience of Audio Books.
A paper book is a very desperate attempt and hope,
to share a deeply personal treasure.
A novel is often times a hidden way to say something,
something that authors don&apos;t want to take personal responsibility for.
If it is on paper,
it is on paper because there was nothing else to put it on.
What other way to transfer Thought Treasures is there,
paper is an improvement over story tellers that would memorize myths and recite them.
I am sure there used to be professional readers,
that would come to a wealthy persons house and beautifully recite a book.
But once we were able to record a book,
an Audio Book became even better than a paper book.
An Audio Book can transfer more emotion,
and a book that is well read by the author, is a treasure, in deed.
An Audio Book will transfer more wisdom than the paper version,
and do not forget about Documentaries, Videos, Lectures and Speeches.
The modern age has been able to greatly enrich the transfer of wisdom,
I beg you to inherit it all, and I hope you do.
The greatest and most enriching Science, Philosophy, Adventure and Storytelling Books,
have not been created to make money or for fame.
The greatest works,
are works created out of Love for Future Generations.
Personal Note,
Due to the way copyright laws work there are many beautiful books in the Public Domain,
if you were to challenge yourself to voice certain books in the most beautiful of ways,
I am sure people from all around the world would love you for it.
Some books that that come to mind are Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, The Art of War by Sun Tzu and
of course Hagakure by Yamamoto Tsunetomo.
Also, keep in mind what a wonderful treasure recordings you made in your youth become as time flows,
what great inheritance to the children of the future to hear their Grand-grand-grand-grand Grandma,
reading Jack London, Leo Tolstoy, Herman Melville, H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, Mary Shelley, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
...And uhh... you know, (and this is just between you and me),
you could uhh... spice up the slower, dryer parts of said books.
You know, mistakes happen, you could for example mix up Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein
with H. G. Wells&apos; Time Machine, and add a sprinkle or two of The Whale by Herman Melville,
and tie it all together with some sweet romantic story from your own wonderful life.
I assure you with all my heart,
it will only make your art of reading,
that much more fascinating.

                  <span class="text-muted">Elementary Schools are still a Dream,
perhaps the most beautiful Achievement of Human Kind.
Before mandatory education people didn&apos;t think poor kids could learn,
people didn&apos;t want poor kids to learn.
But we did it,
we did it, it worked.
It will always work,
we learn to write, to read, numbers.
And multiplication, here is when teachers make the mistake of memorization,
where they look down on the ability to create a multiplication table,
a delayed addition lookup table.
Here, a new kind of memorization begins,
the kind that destroy our climate, our health, our very humanity.
The moment, the teacher, says, MEMORIZE,
they are now working on getting paid.
This is where school breaks down,
where it all falls apart.
In the worst way, now, a lookup table, is a shameful cheat-sheet, it becomes a D+ or a 2+ and it stains,
and it shows up in College papers, all the papers, all the worthless papers.
And this would be fine, except it stains our minds as well,
because deep down we believe even in the worst teachers.
And that belief, in that memorization grade charade,
digs into us, and books start feeling optional, and math useless.
Children grow up without faith in Education and Knowledge,
they don&apos;t believe in the Power of Wisdom, and Noble Teachers and Guardians.
They are still geniuses, powerfully smart, but the betterment of Humanity,
is not the aim, the aim is to prove that they can do whatever it is.
And we lose a child, a student, and gain something else.
The teachers, sold the world,
for a small paycheck.
We can fix this.
First of all, your grades were nonsense,
all the things you couldn&apos;t memorize well enough were not a judgment of your intelligence,
it was a judgment of how well you perform circus tricks, how deep your faith in teachers.
You were a Genius,
we all are, there is no anomaly that grans us magical brains,
it is a function of NOT MEMORIZING, and looking at how the formulas were invented.
You master match by studying its history,
not by memorizing formulas.
Imagine what would happen to Newton,
if he only memorized formulas.
Imagine reading a foreign storybook that way,
just memorizing pronunciation of word after word without learning the language first.
The language for Mathematics is not numbers,
it is love of Universe, of Complexity, search for answers,
gaining insight into the working of the universe, by subtle analogy to the simplified mechanics behind mathematics.
It is a lovely, but primitive language that can be brought to life with computers,
programming, game development, even design.
Past a certain point, people didn&apos;t know how to teach,
so they used memorization, out of desperation.
Memorization temporarily acts like learning, knowing,
the effects wear off in days, where knowledge is the foundation of the heights we reach.
Grades are fake,
you go tricked,
sold for a paycheck.
Most of the sciences are learned by studying their history,
there is no memorization, there is no memorization, there is no memorization.
Just beautiful little notes, journals, lookup tables,
including the multiplication table, but also all the tables you invent.
We are all geniuses,
some take the easy road, and lie, and trick, and manipulate, and pretend, and try to fake it until they make it.
Others,
try to make money, keep bringing a paycheck home, keep lying, get the funding, lower the test standards, process the kids so that all get paid.
We are vulnerable this way,
we tend to believe people in authority.
Even the ones that reject it,
also reject the idea that they are smart.
A mind that rejects memorization in favor of integrity, or authenticity,
shows beauty, shows a love of life.
Genius is just the beginning,
past the Sweet Elementary that I know we all love, we only have books.
There is a lot of Audio Books, a Lot of Mighty Lectures,
but you have to reach out for that.
To do that,
you can&apos;t just hear me saying it;
You have to believe that You were a Genius All Along,
it was just some desperate pretenders along the way trying to put food on their table that tricked you.
I know how to help you regain Faith in Education,
I want you to begin at Concord, Massachusetts, Walden Pond.
I want you, I command you to go see Henry,
go now it matters not that it is not Spring.
You will go back to greet him many times,
go see Henry, at the Walden Pond.
Take a rock, from where you are at right now,
and add it to the pile that&apos;s already there.
Thoreau, in return will help you slow down,
and calm down, he will help you come to a speed that&apos;s necessary for audio books.
You are going to go to England soon,
you are headed for Westminster Abbey.
You are going to visit Sir Isaac.
he will help you understand that Knowledge comes from within.
Take a long time to listen,
understand that you are more than a genius,
you are a creator.
With the Insight granted by Sir Isaac Newton,
and the Peace and Calm bestowed upon you by Henry David Thoreau.
You will find your beginning anew,
you will return to the point where you got tricked into thinking that you are not a genius.
And finally,
let your journey begin at Springer Mountain in Georgia, or Mount Katahdin in Maine,
the others need help, they need to accept the responsibility for their own self education as well.
Please, take many years to section hike the Appalachian Trail,
here Mother Nature and The Kindness of Strangers, and Trail Magic will be your teacher.
Listen, Read, and Write.
Write to get to know yourself, write to figure out the best way to learn,
write to inspire a generation after a generation to make it to their rightful place, as Genius and Creator.
Together We Can Fix It All.
