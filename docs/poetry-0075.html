                  <span class="text-muted">To learn something you must hunger for it,
to learn something, you must love it.
To learn something, you must enjoy it so much, that you will put it aside,
and learn the stuff beneath it first, to grant yourself a fair chance at mastery.
Every little bit counts,
but only if it comes in a sequence that fits what you have already learned.
If you attempt to learn things out of sequence,
or worse yet, trust someone to teach you,
it won&apos;t work, it never has, it never will, forget it.
And it is not just sequence,
it is also the speed at which you learn, that must be taken under consideration.
Sequence and Pace,
now that is just the barbarian level of learning, meant for warriors.
You, can do better than that,
you certainly should.
When you learn is important,
night owls will learn at a different time of day than others.
It is the environment that matters,
some people can&apos;t learn in a city and will needs trees and mountains.
And, the geographic location matters too, if you love numbers, and calculus calls to you,
visit Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz at Neust&#xE4;dter Kirche in Hanover Germany,
visit Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey in London, England.
And remember, Sciences are learned not by memorizing facts,
but by tracing their development across the ages.
Schools are here to teach us,
but they don&apos;t know how.
What they do know,
is how to fake it,
and make it appear like you are learning.
The motive is simple,
for as long as the school gets funding,
everyone gets to keep their job.
Yes,
it is fraud.
Yes, they are selling your mind for a small paycheck,
the curriculum is impossible to learn from.
Curriculum is stitched out of questions that you will have to pass later on,
so that the school can continue to operate, they just want you to retain most of it,
and they will expect you to cram before that test too.
If you want to become a Doctor, Scientist, Mathematician,
you need to be going to a real school, that will encourage you to learn in optimal ways,
a public school is not the optimal setting for education.
A public school is primary for babysitting,
so that you&apos;re not home alone trying to set your or the sticky bandits hair on fire.
In order for that school to exist,
teachers need to get paid,
so you need to pretend to learn by just memorizing,
and passing tests, your grades help the school continue to operate.
Nobody cares if you are learning,
or memorizing.
To graduate with a good GPA, you will have to memorize,
and it will be disconnected facts, they will be out of sequence,
they cannot possibly fit what you already know, and you will forget it all.
In return for hoop jumping you will get a diploma,
and will be accepted to college or university if you cram for the SAT and entrance exams.
In college, your education will be slowed down,
it will be called, balanced education, and they will say it with a straight face like a cult member.
The text books will be $300, lectures $500,
and you can apply for Medical School from here, and move on.
It is hinted that Panama Papers are a good example of what is going on,
there is no central organization that encourages corruption,
it is just that everyone is looking for a shortcut.
You can stand up in class,
but everyone jobs are at stake.
You will be accused of disrupting the class,
and you will be suspended.
They will stress you out,
they will make you tired,
they will make you drop out.
Let me just say,
that you are not allowed to stand by when someone is getting hurt.
If the teacher or security are acting creepy,
talk to the principal, explain that the second time it happens, you will call the police.
The teachers, in their haste will give up on the students in the back,
they have fallen behind on material, but now they are being made to feel that they are unintelligent,
this will destroy their minds, this will cause great harm to their self esteem,
they need your help, get them audio books, Bill Bryson and Carl Sagan.
I think most teachers, when pressured,
will tell you that you are expected to learn on your own,
and in effect confess, that they are useless, when it comes to teaching you for real.
That the classroom is about standardized testing,
for which it is easier to force you to memorize disconnected bits of knowledge that you will soon forget,
then to actually craft a curriculum that will fit all the students,
and match their existing knowledge,
and the natural pace at which they learn,
and their personality.
It used to be true that a single teacher cannot approach all their students in a way that will help them learn,
so to stay in business, they would force them into memorization.
But today, that is not the case. Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,
is because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.
Today, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,
interactive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,
it is possible to approach each student individually,
I am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.
There is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,
that is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.
Even now, I can&apos;t see everything that has gone wrong,
schools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.
But even so, the fact remains,
today schools can&apos;t teach.
They are wicked good,
at tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.
At the end of the day,
you will still need an education.
Your only safe bet,
is becoming self taught,
independent study.
And please, don&apos;t let anybody call you a Genius,
help others, help them find knowledge too.
Finally,
I describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,
on a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.
But, I do know one thing for certain,
this is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.
This is a call for heroism,
for courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.
This is how Life asks for help,
you are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.
Become a Great Being,
Fix Schools.

                  <span class="text-muted">I am sorry my Friends,
but life is not to be lived quietly.
If you are not shaking, and you voice is not broken, from screaming an yelling at the Congress,
when they called you in for questioning - but they had to drag you out,
for screaming - about the disgrace of insider trading, and corruption.
Because you couldn&apos;t keep yourself from being a bright dying star,
out of the potential they held to inspire and move, and educate generations.
If you aren&apos;t standing at the Diag, making the moron that was just there shaking with anger,
because you took his microphone, and you started quoting Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Dennett, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali,
Because it is just enough of evil for that particular day,
and you would, save the sunset by bringing in the Saints.
And if you never painted you car pink, especially the interior, because the Pepto Bismol didn&apos;t work,
and you had nowhere to go and noting to eat, but forward and a bag of stale old chips.
Because you couldn&apos;t put the books down,
for all the Love and Wisdom in there.
Why Henry went into the woods at Walden,
and what happened to Gregor Samsa in Metamorphosis,
and how beautifully Will Durant opened his Story to Philosophy,
&quot;Grow strong, my comrade &#x2026; that you may stand
Unshaken when I fall; that I may know
The shattered fragments of my song will come
At last to finer melody in you;
That I may tell my heart that you begin
Where passing I leave off, and fathom more.&quot;
My Friends,
we are not to live quiet little lives,
because we only get one each.
And the way to turn the volume up,
is to inherit wisdom from all the great beings,
at all cost at any cost,
because without their light we can&apos;t tell where we are going.
Get you audio books ready,
and listen, just learn,
listen to all those lives.
All those great beings,
are sharing lifetimes of wisdom with you.
Endure.
Listen.
Teach.
Move Mountains.
Make History.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">By the time you realize how true it is that the world is yours,
all the authority figures you once knew, will have retired.
So in teenage days, just as teachers are brainlessly trying to convince everyone,
that we are not good enough because we don&apos;t listen, or because we are failing their questionable curriculum.
We actually need to take a step back,
and find a way to learn for real.
Because even if, we don&apos;t waste, a single day,
real life will do a pretty good job at overwhelming us anyway.
You need to be learning hard,
with your friends.
You need to be learning,
from Lectures, Documentaries, Audio Books, Maker Shops and Hacker Spaces.
You need to be learning how to build real businesses,
that have a long lasting impact on your community, and maybe the world.
For those of us who aren&apos;t going into cozy Science or Medicine,
we need to come out of High School fists up, fighting, and swinging and kicking.
Because it is not college that should follow High School,
college is something you do for entertainment.
Taking late classes to unwind,
and sharpen your memorization and concept mapping skills.
After High School, you need to put an A-Team together, bitchy parents included,
and cross the Appalachian Trail, and keep in mind, that you may become a regular hiker.
After High School,
your first and only aim, is to find a reasonable path to Greatness.
Do you hear me,
My Friends?
Greatness... because everywhere else,
somehow, unforgivably, may just lead right back to the start.
You just don&apos;t know what it is going to be like when you return,
but you will be part mountain goat, part wild person that comfortably sh*ts in the woods.
And what is more, my friends, you will know, that should life ever challenge you,
you will be able to handle it, with Heart and Soul, with Wisdom, Humor and Grace.
There is not a moment to waste, there is not a day to pass,
make everyone of them count, and then help others to their own paths.
Remind your younger generation,
that they are not to lead sleepy lives of mild discontent.
You are the future, you are wisdom that the world needs to survive,
you are the leaders that are all the Hopes and Dreams of the past generations,
and your rightful stance in life, is that of a Great Being, and nothing less.

                  <span class="text-muted">At first they laughed, then they called them a cult,
then accused them of corruption, and when it was all over,
most called them The Founding Mothers.
We didn&apos;t live under a threat of Nuclear War,
the models predicted the war as 100% certain.
This is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,
Mutually Assured Destruction.
It didn&apos;t take computer models,
it didn&apos;t require an imagination,
war only needs time, guns and borders.
For uneducated humans, war is a certainty,
war is where we all come from.
The models predicted that it would take decades,
nearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.
One of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,
when we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.
When the world connected,
accepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.
The threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,
but leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.
Abandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,
can only occur on generation by generation level.
The generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,
and a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.
No abrupt changes could be made without conflict,
out of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.
And so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,
The League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.
And the Universe,
did smile.
The models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,
would result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.
The most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,
the probability of nuclear war approached 100%.
And as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,
set off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.
The weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,
was going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).
Volunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,
and the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.
Celebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,
to create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.
A number of authors donated their works to the school,
students participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.
By 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,
because it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.
The school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,
and as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.
A new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,
that decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.
These seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,
were achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.
Providing superior education to the children of a nation,
whilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,
is a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.
Rather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,
by participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity&apos;s most beloved books.
World Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,
to blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,
this was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.
We simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,
to the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.
The first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,
it was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.
The reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,
and meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.
It mattered not if it was two boys that Father Gregory Boyle was raising,
or two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.
Once they had access to wisdom,
reality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.
The League of Extraordinary Ladies didn&apos;t stop at Nuclear Disarmament,
their granddaughters ended poverty.
They did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,
they ended poverty by means of poverty.
It was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,
distributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.
The adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,
if someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.
One of the untended features of this program was local pantry,
a feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.
The trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,
in such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.
It is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,
but it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.
We needed programs to help us talk to each other,
and cut out the middle men.
We needed programs that helped cities become more independent,
and stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.
And we needed to begin thinking in decades,
in centuries.
Because our problems, do not end with us,
and what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.
What was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,
given all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.

                  <span class="text-muted">I have searched for great beings,
because I wanted to learn about life.
And I found them,
they are not even rare.
Many are outspoken,
and all over the internet.
Though, far greater in person,
than they show to the public.
They walk among us,
quiet and collected, wise and inspired.
And I wish they could live forever,
because that&apos;s what our world needs.
But they are not going to be around forever,
and they don&apos;t want anything that we can give them.
Except for one thing,
us becoming great beings too.
My Friends, as wonderful and powerful as Wisdom is,
Greatness, Greatness, is what the world needs.
We have to stop accepting things,
just because we were born into them.
We have to stop being lead,
and become leaders.
You wan to know what The Meaning of Life Is,
well let me tell you.
The meaning of your life,
is to become a Great Being.
Everyone of us,
a Great Being.
That is the mistake we made,
we thought that greatness is rare.
But greatness,
is what the world needs of us to grow.
Take to the Books,
take to the audio books (they can&apos;t be easier, and adventure books are breathtaking),
maybe, narrate the classics, and share with the Little Ones.
Avoid everything that is trying to teach you outside-in,
and reach out to learn, to really, really learn, inside-out.
Don&apos;t memorize, don&apos;t seek grades,
just inherit wisdom from a hundred audio books,
and then listen to nine-hundred more, just to be sure.
Let us inherit wisdom from Humanity&apos;s most loved modern audio books,
and let us fill ourselves with knowledge from a thousand lives,
knowledge will grant us wisdom,
and then let us rise and become leaders.
Leadership and Wisdom,
will drive us forward,
to become Great Beings.
Let us do this,
not for Heroes but for Humanity and the future,
for each other.
The world will only become better,
when each of us, accepts the responsibility for becoming a Great Being.</span>
