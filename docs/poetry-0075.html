                  <span class="text-muted">Invent everything,
we are all extremely smart.
We can learn anything,
so as long as we don&apos;t skip any steps along the way.
And so as long,
as all steps are interesting and fun to us.
Never force yourself to learn something you don&apos;t enjoy,
just keep reading books, and keep looking for something to strike your fancy.
From Dreaming, and Inventing,
to Art, Programming and taking to the skies.
An invention can be as simple,
as an LED Throwie or LED Glowie.
Just a Light Emitting Diode, a battery and magnet,
to keep it all together; and as a bonus make it stick to metal surfaces.
That is a three component invention,
LED, magnet, battery.
My favorite Radio Astronomer,
Seth Shostak.
Quips, that the baseline for determining if a member of a species is intelligent,
is whether or not it can hold a soldering iron, and make a radio.
Allow me to get you soldering a radio,
as quickly as possible.
Get a Raspberry PI Zero W (the W stands for Wireless or &quot;with WI-FI&quot;),
a soldering kit, a solder wick, some GPIO headers,
and a 4 x 8 RGB LED HAT that fits a Raspberry PI Zero neatly.
Look everything up on YouTube,
how to solder, how to solder headers, how to use a solder wick.
This is serious business,
in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.
Though get a $30 kit
that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.
At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,
and set it up on the network.
But later as you figure everything out,
you unplug everything leaving just the power.
To get inside it,
you use a remote terminal.
Once you login,
you get a command prompt.
It listens to words, to commands,
very similar to adventure games.
Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,
are very much like rooms in a game.
To get inside Documents,
type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;
The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,
Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.
When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,
you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.
The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,
just a couple of words and nothing more.
But sometimes, that is not enough,
like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.
We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,
we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.
You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,
it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.
To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,
which is short for list, or list files.
&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,
you can ask it for help like above.
But also ask it to list files in a long format,
by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,
the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.
To list files with readable file sizes,
you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;
Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,
the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,
you just use the short versions.
The command line interface is trying to be your friend,
it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.
There are many tutorials on how to use the command line,
and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference
Here are instructions on how to play audio through HDMI,
your monitor should have an audio out somewhere.
Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,
and try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights based on this tutorial.
Alternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on this instructable,
note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.
And there is also a Raspberry PI WH,
meaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.
And now, get a $10 camera,
and use raspistill to take a photo,
and play around with all the other options.
Now you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,
a programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.
You can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,
you can get an LCD screen and turn it into a tablet.
Raspberry PI is not the only Single-board computer,
PINE looks really nice as well.
If you are looking for a more complicated project,
perhaps try building a Raspberry PI Drone,
bonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.
We have no limits,
but we are also very unique.
Our inventions need not rely on commuters,
some of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.
Don&apos;t let anybody stop you from inventing,
and don&apos;t stop dreaming.
Finally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,
make for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.
Aim,
for the Moon.

                  <span class="text-muted">Of course, it is not just aging,
but is it also more than just learning.
Some say &quot;Lean into the discomfort.&quot;,
others &quot;Don&apos;t try go all the way.&quot;.
It is all about building ourselves,
layer by layer.
The layers,
need not always be on the same subject.
You may start an artist, or a dreamer, or a mechanic,
and then move to urban explorer, photographer, and islander.
The steps we take are slightly different,
from what we take away.
An artist learns the harmony of colors,
the strange simplicity of desaturating colors by mixing opposites.
The dreamer learns that a dream is not just a dream,
because if you snag on it and carry it out, it will become true.
The mechanic learns about a screw,
if you tighten it too much you will ruin it.
The urban explorer learns that the attorney,
that left his stuff behind was always suffering and died alone.
The photographer learns that it is the journey,
and the photo is a mere bookmark in memories.
And the islander,
ohh, the islander.
Finally, when the golden age of wisdom and endless aches and grunts comes,
the islander learns that life is to be lived fully.
And what that means, is that we take what we learned from the day before,
mix it with today, and get it ready to mix it with tomorrow.
Like a waterfall that runs into to the ocean,
the new things we learn add to the body of the old.
With old age being a privilege denied to so many,
the treasure we carry truly becomes magnificent as we move forth.
We can&apos;t learn all at once,
and we can&apos;t fully learn through synthetic means.
At schools the curriculum is so warped,
it can only be dishonestly memorized.
Audio Books and Lectures, go a long way,
so as long as you make room for the lessons within.
Education requires room, here there can be no stress from grades,
no craziness for a high GPA, brand name education, and a promise of a job.
We need life, we need the full thickness of life,
and then an urge to study will emerge.
That thick life,
will move us.
It will uncover an absence of knowledge,
and it will feel great to fill it right up with precisely 14 books on the subject.
A synthetic education born from being forced to learn,
is a very poor education.
Memorization,
is not an education at all, it is actually dangerous and stupid.
And networking with grads from a brand name university to get stuff done,
has nothing to do with getting educated, it is a service trading club.
Learning from books,
whilst walking a huge trail filled with Bobcats and Mountain Lions,
is far superior of a teacher than anything claiming to educate today.
And one of the best things about books,
is that they make mistakes sometimes.
Their authors get so inspired,
that their ideas sometimes take off and fly in the sky.
And when you catch a famous Author on such a flight of fancy,
you learn even more, you learn about Excellence.
(And how useless, and desperate, and child like book critics are.)
Medical Schools are not an exception here,
textbooks are important, practice even more,
but so is healing a person on the inside, within their mind.
We can all imagine an excellent doctor, extremely professional,
perfect grades, well read, awesome person all around, no complaints.
And we can imagine what it is like to suffer without hope,
and seeing this kind individual, just move on to the next patient.
See, being a perfect Doctor, is not enough,
the surgery is not over when the procedure is done.
And people can tell when someone merely follows etiquette,
and merely pops in for a moment to say something nice, and be done with it.
Be it a Doctor, Scientist, Musician, Artist,
Dreamer, Adventurer, Rebel, even Beloved Professor...
...more is needed.
Greatness of heart,
is a really good start.
But, I think the golden standard of Life and Art,
is; Vastness of Heart.
There is no describing it, but these Beautiful Beings,
smile, and laugh, no matter the weather,
And when they speak, they seem to be part of Cosmos,
not just Earth.
A Mechanic who borrows from his work,
for purposes of Wisdom.
Will hold up a screw,
and say.
&quot;In order for this important piece of the system to do its job,
you have to know when too much of tightening the screw will damage it.&quot;
This is a good example of what we see in schools,
Elementary is a Dream, Middle School kind of works,
but creating High School by just making subjects more demanding, is insane.
The screw is tightened,
damaged, and now, it cannot be repaired.
At the very least, we must help the children to create a start-up,
to work together on building 3D printed inventions, learning Linux, and coming up with new stuff.
And help them setup a way of charging customers,
a way of advertising products, and wipe their fears of poverty.
The kids, are always smarter than us,
they build on top of what we have built.
We are not giving them the tools for their future,
we teach pure Trigonometry and this cannot be dumber.
Because to teach Trigonometry,
all the teacher has to do is create a class about
building games that get published on Steam (game store).
What a teacher may not do,
is force feed pure triangle garbage to people who don&apos;t have an interest in it.
It is not hormones (and no teacher should ever say that), students simply stop listing,
when they figure out the teachers are... selling them out for a paycheck.
Dreamers are my favorite,
here is someone who sits down and thinks up the following,
&quot;If I was born on a different continent,
to a different religion, I would be asked to worship that other god that I am told is false.&quot;
&quot;Furthermore,&quot; - and you know there is always a furthermore,
that&apos;s part of the reason why they cannot be stopped.
&quot;Aren&apos;t we all atheists,
to all the other gods.&quot;
And just when you think she was done with it,
she adds &quot;Why don&apos;t we go the extra step and love All Life, All Wisdom, All Good Ideas, and All Human Beings&quot;
And the next thing you know,
you realize she was never a Dreamer, nor was she ever little.
She&apos;s a Philosopher.
To tell children, that there exists a group of Universal Beings,
that dedicate their lives and immortality to Wisdom,
and passing it on to all the future generations,
is to help them grow from the highest of mountains.
And the Urban Explorer,
they see homes after the families left.
They see pictures,
and smiles, and forgotten hopes.
They see passage of time,
they see the motion of generation upon generation.
They can see the homes as they were on Christmas,
and they can read the medical bills scattered in the corner.
These so called scoundrels,
often chased away like dogs.
They are working on wording a lesson,
that they hope to voice some day.
Maybe come their golden age,
as Guggenheim shows their works.
They will speak of leaving bad ideas behind,
and sharing in all the good ones.
How truly precious all our daily chores,
how it is these little ordinary moments that add to create almost all our lives.
&quot;There are no ordinary moments&quot; as Dan Millman says.
Layer by layer, and the sequence will come deep from within the heart,
and it will reveal it self by means of curiosity.
When a day comes, and you find yourself looking out the window,
with more pleasure than than writing games or interactive fiction,
or managing your corporation, or putting out fire tornadoes.
Deep from within your heart,
a new curiosity calls to you.
And it can only make you better,
better at what you do, help you climb higher than the height you are on right now.
You don&apos;t have to switch careers,
but you do need to throw a loaf of bread into your back pack.
And hit the trail.
If you are out east Section Hike the Appalachian Trail,
if you are out west than hike the Pacific Crest Trail,
if you are out in the Pacific then set of for the Kalalau on the island of Ka&apos;uai.
Bring your Audio Books,
and make no mistake,
Because the end of that trail,
marks only the beginning of your new adventure.
Remember the aim, my friends:
Vastness Of Heart!</span>

But don&apos;t drive back home, just turn south on 275,
and drive.
We&apos;re going all the way down,
to take care of your frown.
You&apos;ll drive through Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
right till you get to good old Georgia.
Here you stop, and get some sleep.
but wake up early, cause we got a pace to keep.
Drive all the way through Florida to US Highway One,
and be ready to catch some sun.
Get to Little Duck Key,
and park beneath a palm tree.
Now, squirt some suntan lotion.
and enjoy the Ocean.

                  <span class="text-muted">Our cognitive biases,
will only keep causing trouble for as long as we are unaware of them.
Eventually, new, fully functional educational systems,
will help us to Knowledge and Wisdom.
As we learn to trust computers,
we will learn to stop relying on easily corruptible career politicians.
The educated voter democracies of the future,
will stand as powerful machines helping us manage our cities and Earth with the wisdom of the crowds.
The world before us lost 99% of its species,
the climate is ever changing.
The layer of oxygen we all rely on is extraordinary thin,
and most of earth is Ocean and the rest requires that we protect ourselves from elements.
While we are bound to this planet chemically,
Earth never really relied on us for anything.
We are not the destroyers, not is Earth,
we are simply yet to be fully awakened caretakers and maintainers.
We need a more powerful educational system,
one that reaches deep into all corners of Humanity,
From Yawanawa, Romani, Maasai, Samoyeds, Rotumans, and Hawaiians,
we all have to come together now as a single family.
What must connect us, is education,
which is just a path to Knowledge and Wisdom.
Whoever we are, and whatever we think we are doing,
we are made much better by inheritance of Knowledge and Wisdom,
which in turn begets Compassion, and Empathy, and the very cure for our Cognitive Biases.
The Love of The Human Family,
and the Insight and Understanding it entails.
It is OK to have made mistakes,
it is just our cognitive biases,
and lack of education, and poverty, and fear.
But it is not OK to stay within the confines of those mistakes,
Earth needs our help, the animals need our help too,
and we can&apos;t help them without Education and the Unity it entails.
All it will take is Storytellers and Lovers of Science and Knowledge,
and Narrators, reading it all in the many languages.
May this century,
become The Century Of The School.
A tiny Audio Player, perhaps a solar powered School on a Chip,
or free access satellites that truly bring the internet to all.
We don&apos;t have to Love All Humanity at first,
just the Tigers, the Big Pussy Cats, 3,890 left,
let us come together now, let us help Earth and all of her inhabitants.
And where education leads,
the nations will follow.

if you don&apos;t start in the beginning.
We learn a new language out there,
the edge grants us a new vocabulary.
A vocabulary, is also an aid for thinking,
it helps us navigate better.
And the edge is a sacred place,
there you can quietly comprehend what all Great Beings speak of.
And, it becomes your anchor,
the thing that makes sense.
it becomes the point from which you measure other things,
as you progress forward.
And, Look who else is here,
the Elder You.
They all come here, at every plateau, in each great loneliness,
ask them what their regrets are, and prevent them all from occurring.
The edge is a sacred place,
you are always safe out here, you are always welcome, and you are never alone.</span>
