          <p>Authenticity would be Wonderful on its own,<br>
            it helps with trust, admiration, knowing, feeling.</p>
          <p>But, actually, it is far more than that,<br>
            it reflects Fundamental Principles of The Universe.</p>
          <p>There is a very big difference, between crossing a real bridge,<br>
            and a fake one.</p>
          <p>Or, reading a book for real, and pretending to read.<br>
            Or, studying a Field of Science and, and cramming for a test.<br>
            Or, doing something for a grade, and doing something for your mind.<br>
            Or, doing something for real, and pretend to do something.<br>
            Or, being your complete self, and being what others approve of.<br></p>
          <p>The one thing in common here, is one is a fantasy that ends,<br>
            and the other, just is ... and grows, and alters the course of life ahead.</p>
          <p>It is a testament to our connection with the Universe,<br>
            that an Authentic Human Being will grow Healthy and Strong, and Keep Expanding.</p>
          <p>The best example of this is getting an education that looks great on paper,<br>
            but does nothing for interacting with the real word.</p>
          <p>A similar example has to do with a great job that pays well, that goes great,<br>
            but halts a person&apos;s development, and robs them of their youth, dreams, and hopes,<br>
            robs them of the highest version of themselves.</p>
          <p>Time, cannot be warped, or faked,<br>
            it ticks away, our bodies grow, day by day, year by year, decade by decade.</p>
          <p>The long-vision of becoming of ourselves, will reveal that the first and foremost,<br>
            and most dominant and meaningful thing, is our acquisition of wisdom.</p>
          <p>Acquisition of Wisdom is deeply connected to Authenticity,<br>
            Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Pursuit of Knowledge, Rising, Growing Up.</p>
          <p>Time helps our bodies progress forward,<br>
            but it is Wisdom that helps our Minds.</p>
          <p>Authenticity, gives us this incredible power to start something today,<br>
            that will make us Wiser, Healthier, Happier, Filled with More Insight.</p>
          <p>And not merely tomorrow, but for all our time to come,<br>
            as in Authenticity, each day adds to the previous.</p>
