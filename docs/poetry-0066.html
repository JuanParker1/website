        <p>We are not robots, to be taught,<br>
          we are humans powered by inventive and original thought.</p>
        <p>This is why life has no instruction book,<br>
          if it did, it could only ever tell us where to look.</p>
        <p>For the sake of this poem,<br>
          let us image that this book does, exist.</p>
        <p>Here is how I imagine it would read,<br>
          and let me start with the opening creed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If someone is attacking you call for help, until it comes.</li>
          <li>If school is treating you unfairly, go hang out with the Principal.</li>
          <li>You need to build your Content of Character.</li>
          <li>Your Body of Wisdom is a Key To Happiness.</li>
          <li>You Must Grow All The Way Up.</li>
          <li>You are to Become a Great Being.</li>
          <li>You Are Beautiful, You Were Beautiful All Along.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It would point to learn from The Greats<br>
          as they managed to lift impossible weights.<br></p>
        <p>It would also say that we are delicate,<br>
          and our minds are extremely intricate.</p>
        <p>It would add, Hey!<br>
          You can not grow up in places that weigh.</p>
        <p>You have to find you own place in the world,<br>
          and you have to quit doing what you are told.</p>
        <p>Above all it would state,<br>
          that you are Free,<br>
          and Full of Beauty.<br>
          and searching for Wisdom is your duty.</p>
