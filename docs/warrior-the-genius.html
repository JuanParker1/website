                    <p>Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks.</p>
                    <p>One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: The
                      English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication.</p>
                    <p>The &quot;Double U&quot;, the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet
                      has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the
                      comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?</p>
                    <p>Rhymes.</p>
                    <p>Poems.</p>
                    <p>Songs.</p>
                    <p>Letters.</p>
                    <p>Essays.</p>
                    <p>Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades,
                      parents?</p>
                    <p>Memorizing Poems?</p>
                    <p>Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did.</p>
                    <p>Speaking. Reading. Writing.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like
                      Storytelling, for example.</p>
                    <p>You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings,
                      now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, and
                      Faster Than Light Travel.</p>
                    <p>You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted
                      objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on
                      a message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will mark
                      forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it
                      alive across centuries even as English evolves.</p>

                    <p>Was the Dragon a mere reminder, a clumsy blurb for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">Memento Mori</a> or is
                      that just the introduction to the real story, the story that has little to
                      do with men like Beowulf who can&apos;t even take down a fat flying lizard
                      right. A story burned to the ground by the spirit of the age, the Greatest
                      Story Never Told, The Story of The Ides of the Old World.</p>
                    <p>Pick up the pen. Rebuild the story a thousand times, and let the version

                    <p>I am wiser now, the text is for a teenager. But I feel no shame for still
                      holding it dear to my heart. I am glad to share with you.</p>

                    <p>At the age of 15 or earlier, you master a framework almost as complex as
                      any of the more interesting Daughters of Philosophy (The Sciences).</p>
                    <p>It comes to you so naturally, that you don&apos;t notice it.</p>
                    <p>You think we are born with the ability for language.</p>

                      will change meaning, as you grow; possibly/hopefully even reverse.</p>
                    <p>Similar to how &quot;We make use of a service already existing without paying

                      <h2>Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means
                      progressive, gradual learning and mastery.</p>
                    <p>It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words
                      without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here &quot;The English
                      Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication&quot; bonds really well with
                      our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human
                      learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it
                      would still be a functional, but very different language.</p>
                    <p>Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive
                      adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn
                      something, it won&apos;t be learned.</p>
                    <p>But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously
                      had trouble with it. For example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Created_the_Integers">God Created the Integers: The
                        Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History</a> Stephen Hawking helped
                      his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I
                      view the book as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">Memory Palace</a> with emphasis on historical dates and
                      progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the
                      reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.</p>

                      <h2>Memorizing &#x3C0;r&#xB2;</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Do you remember memorizing &#x3C0;r&#xB2;?</p>
                    <p>Forcing memorization of &#x3C0;r&#xB2; or any formula, should be seen as psychological
                      torture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspension
                      of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made.</p>
                    <p>Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English without
                      the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel.</p>
                    <p>Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can&apos;t comprehend &#x3C0;r&#xB2;, and her mind
                      rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is
                      squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there
                      a geometric square somehow?</p>
                    <p>Warm, but not warm enough.</p>
                    <p>A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forced
                      to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.</p>
                    <p>People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural
                      predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally
                      predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not
                      to, learn Mathematics, or be punished.</p>

                      <h2>Math</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when
                      compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of
                      programming.</p>
                    <p>Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in
                      mathematics.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a></p>
                    <p>It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for
                      paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a> notes
                      &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,
                      context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).&quot;</p>
                    <p>It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton
                      from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to
                      waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.</p>
                    <p>Let us face that today&apos;s &quot;Alphabet of Math&quot; is basic Programming. This is
                      because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to
                      latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn
                      out to be to you now.</p>
                    <p>As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge
                      come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">P5js</a> or
                      maybe <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, or even <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> (keep it in sync with leading Web
                      Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming,
                      exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment
                      opportunities).</p>
                    <p>Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life
                      when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games,
                      visualizations.</p>

                    <p>It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a>
                      children who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and Abstract
                      Mathematics. A child using the program that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language">Karlie teaches with</a> will
                      see little surface difference between making a rectangle and converting
                      matter to energy via Einstein&apos;s E=mc&#xB2;. A venture into the function
                      contents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, may
                      perhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet,

                    <p>In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic
                      calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates
                      rectangles with a base twice the height.</p>
                    <p>For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull them

                      <h2>Memorization is Over</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Tell your teacher that memorization is over, it is useless to you.</p>
                    <p>Tell your teachers that they are not allowed to stand in your way of real
                      knowledge.</p>
                    <p>They are interrupting your real education by threatening to mark you down
                      for not following their worthless directions which can only lead to
                      memorization, which in turn will soon result in you forgetting what you
                      force-remembered.</p>
                    <p>It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way you
                      did it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken
                      advantage of. The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, school
                      qualifying for more funding.</p>
                    <p>GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people will
                      easily mislead you. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy">Vaccine Hesitancy</a> which a lot of
                      people fall for, but there are more complicated and closer calls like
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion">CFCs</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE2uwBA3EAw">Tetraethyl Lead</a>, and now <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22116696">PFAS</a>. You need to be
                      knowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in the
                      world.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don&apos;t
                      count on the adults, they&apos;re all going to retire of old age soon enough.</p>
                    <p>Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on
                      everything from internal decision making, to external politics of the whole
                      World.</p>
                    <p>The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and you
                      will become the future.</p>
                    <p>Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way.</p>
                    <p>You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books.</p>
                    <p>Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot.</p>

                      people saying they are better than you because they are a Genius, are sick
                      from poverty of mind, they got fractured, stuck. It is sad, let us hope
                      they feel better and catch up, but pass them on as they heal.</p>
                    <p>Keep moving forward, keep learning, the World needs you to grow, to grow
                      all the way up, you, and all your peers, and all generations to come.</p>
                    <p>It is the journey of self education that makes the real difference.</p>
                    <p>Begin your journey under the banner of Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence
                      and Love of Wisdom.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett: English political leader, activist, writer and feminist icon. Known as a campaigner for women&apos;s suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until 1919 she led Britain&apos;s largest women&apos;s rights organisation, the National Union of Women&apos;s Suffrage Societies. The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.: Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop, and often block traffic. If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want to do their job, go home, and get paid. If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job and go watch some TV. You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&apos;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot; and you&apos;ll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you&apos;ll struggle to remember where it all started and what the battle was for. Because The Battle Is Not For You: The battle is for those that come; after you. In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the same. In long term, you help the world grow, it won&apos;t be your world, it will be the world of the future. The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education are two separate things. It will make you tired. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood. Bad News: There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too low. Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education, the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot; grades, making your parents happy. Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never looking back. Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue. Henry David Thoreau: I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.
