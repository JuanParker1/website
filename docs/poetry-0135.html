                    <p>I dreamt I was tumbling through time,</p>
                    <p>and I had no control over which fragments I see.</p>

                    <p>There was a mother writing a letter to a famous movie star,</p>
                    <p>she was asking him to stop making movies, because her boy didn&apos;t comeback from war.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>And it worked,</p>
                    <p>and she wrote many letters.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>There was a lot of shocked artists and actors,</p>
                    <p>they had no idea how they shaped young impressionable minds.</p>

                    <p>Boys wanted to go to real war,</p>

                    <p>And then I struggled in my dream, because my bullies were clearly ill, they were not all there,</p>
                    <p>but World&apos;s Systems of Justice do not differentiate between the ill and the healthy.</p>

                    <p>is seen equal to a man of knowledge, insight, intelligence.</p>

                    <p>To punish someone who couldn&apos;t grow up, didn&apos;t know to learn,</p>
                    <p>for something that they weren&apos;t sure they were doing,</p>
                    <p>and then to send them to a hopeless place without a hope of healing,</p>
                    <p>without any hope of rehabilitation... is wrong.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each human being contains precisely one labyrinth mostly consisting of a single long winding road with plenty of forks.
this is their own perfect, private, personal, sacred curriculum.
If they are granted the opportunity to follow it,
at their own pace, in their own way, they will eventually become Wise.
This wondrous road, must double as a library,
and it can only contain Humanity&apos;s Noblest Works of Knowledge and Wisdom.
The men who created, and rebuilt, and mixed up, and reformed the standardized education curricula,
are politicians, bureaucrats, and fake it until you make artists with something but temporary to prove.
Most had agendas, made trades, deals, promises,
some worked to compress one part, while others added more garbage to the next.
Unlike a road, there is no path that leads up the Tree of Knowledge here,
the standardized curriculum is a patchwork of political fantasies.
It shows a complete misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
and great emphasis on easy administration of tests that only an uneducated voter would see any value in.
Our path of exploration,
is sacred.
You are unique,
you cannot be replaced.
There are no actors,
that could pretend to be you.
And you are a key,
a key to a higher understanding of the Universe and Human Condition.
No one can interrupt your quest for wisdom,
and you should never suspend it or give up.
That beautiful road of questions and answers,
forks, and diverging paths that lead you up.
Up to the very top of the Tree of Knowledge,
to grow up, and move Mountains, and become a Great Being.
That beautiful road and mountains beyond hold the answers,
that the world needs in other to Grow, and Heal, and Mature.
Your life may seem ordinary,
but it is not.
The universe is always gasping for more brilliance,
and when the roads are denied or not taken, it grows darker for it.
Even your sadness,
makes the universe darker.
The world needs you to grow,
it needs our brilliance to become an Enlightened, Wise and Peaceful Place.
It just so happens that we have tiny flaw,
we accept authority, and believe the culture we are born into.
In a world where schools follow a curriculum that is a patchwork,
of political promises, and lowest common denominator garbage meant to easily test progress.
We fall in to the rabbit hole,
we become indoctrinated into the belief that education is not our own path,
But a hodge-podge of trinkets,
that we must toil and moil to unpack to try to make some sense of.
It is possible to follow your own path,
and then come back to school and come out with a perfect grade.
But doing this also adds legitimacy to a very sick system,
that removes people natural predisposition for beauty to replace it with a mere impression of knowledge.
Many will wholly reject the fact that schools are broken,
because it is all they knew.
Heartbreakingly, they will hold up a beautiful book by a beloved Science Popularizer,
and laugh at how it left out at all the things that they have memorized in class.
But Knowledge is not about recalling all the facts,
be it by memorization or mnemonic.
Knowledge, is about synthesizing new observations, new ideas, new challenges,
from magnificent conjecture to newly discovered brilliant theories, formulas, facts, and inventions.
And, not at some abstract point, post graduation which after all a mere piece of paper,
but the genesis of new ideas from the moment you finish reading your fifth book on a subject you like.
The way you progress through your labyrinth of discovery, and that path through the tree of knowledge, is baby step at a time,
sometimes you&apos;ll discover something that will take you left, sometimes right, but you will always move upwards, always growing up.
Your path must be a sequence of steps that make sense to you,
pleasant answers to your curiosities.
Your path is deeply personal,
it helps your mind to grow Strong and Healthy.
Standardized education, is so mixed up that it is best memorized,
but memorization can only be temporary, it is not helpful in ideas synthesis, it is only helpful for actors and pretenders.
Schools are a recent invention, and it was a lot worse before, but now we need more,
a clearer, more personalized, more honest, more loving schools, that help to guide people towards Wisdom and Knowledge.
But to achieve that dream, we must take responsibility for our own education first,
only then will we know how to build the next generation of schools.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Do not drop out of High School,
the Back Row is a special place.
It is how the Universe asks for help,
you are being asked to watch for trouble.
To keep an eye on your bullies,
make sure they all come back from home.
Their violence is an expression of abuse,
there is nothing you can do.
You are being asked to stare into the Teachers Soul,
especially when the bullies come, and she turns her head.
And you are being asked to be the first one to call the police,
if someone is in danger, get everything on video, upload.
Watch the Security Guards,
make sure that everyone is keeping a distance from all the students.
So, by now the teachers have you half way,
towards believing that you are dumb, a loser, and a waste of time.
They have been using you to tidy up their Grade Statistics,
their statistics can&apos;t stick out, they need a usual distribution of grades.
If it was all As, someone would come around asking why,
you are the &quot;F&quot; that makes their bullshit look legitimate.
I know, you know, that your grades your bad, because you were not learning before,
and now you don&apos;t have the base, that would help you understand what the teacher is saying right now.
But you are wrong.
Nobody else learned that stuff either,
even some of the kids that had tutors, didn&apos;t learn it, they just memorized it.
You&apos;d have to be a freak of nature,
to actually comprehend that curriculum, please, please, don&apos;t memorize garbage.
Be careful, the teachers, and principals maybe suffering a kind of collective delusion:
&quot;...The principal and I rejected his alibi and hung a fat zero on his final exam.
That dropped his precalculus grade down from a B+ to a D+.
It lingered like a purple bruise on his college applications.&quot;
Ben Orlin &quot;When Memorization Gets in the Way of Learning&quot; The Atlantic, September 9, 2013.
You are just as smart as everybody else,
you are just as smart as Newton was before he started reading books he liked.
There are no gifted individuals,
but there are individuals who like being celebrated as gifted, of special, or above all else.
They want it so bad,
that they go home and memorize that garbage, garbage.
Even though your mind is perfectly fine,
you still need Knowledge, you need an integrated picture of the world.
A clear picture constructed out of a hundred books,
loved an admired by Intellectuals, Scientists, Philosophers, those who show great achievement.
By sitting in the back row, and constantly being made to feel stupid,
they are stressing you out and preventing you from enjoying life up to a point where you can listen to Audio Books and Lectures.
This place is standing between you and knowledge,
and calling you stupid while its at it.
This is why you can&apos;t drop out,
because if this continues the world will fall apart.
Your real study,
begins right now.
You have to figure out,
how this place works.
Who the teachers answer to,
who the principals answer to.
How are they getting paid,
for this s*it.
You have to understand the school system,
because you are going to fix it.
There is a couple of teachers,
and a handful of students that will help you.
Learn from the internet how to give speeches,
and begin preparing yourself for speaking out against fake education.
Forgive the memorizes, they are often under as much pressure as the bullies are,
they are just better at keeping their mind from fracturing.
Some of them maybe admiring you,
that you are so strong that you don&apos;t pretend to learn.
If one of the girls tries to talk to you,
don&apos;t freak out just say the truth:
&quot;I am shy, I need some time to be able to speak with you,
if you help me, I&apos;ll be your friend.&quot;
and then add,
&quot;I am going to try to fix school, I&apos;ll need a lot of help.&quot;
And everything will work out.
My Friend,
A school that pretends to teach,
is a school that robs you of knowledge.
Civilizations do not die with a bang,
it happens so slowly that nobody notices when all the trees are gone.
How many Tigers are left in your time?
I hope you still have a few, I had 4,000 when I wrote this.
The Nuclear superpowers,
chose Mutually Assured Destruction, over Disarmament.
And prisons were full of people who were warped,
by stress, poverty, and lack of Knowledge,
it was Ten Million at the time of writing.
The blindness starts in school,
when Knowledge is replaced with disconnected facts and memorization.
And it continues,
grow strong my friend,
speak Wisely, Nobly and Loudly.
Imagine what it will be like when it is all over, and schools begin working.
Every formula animated before student&apos;s eyes, paid internships all around the word,
student exchange will be the first and foremost, adventures in England, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and why not.
Student Stipend will grant the students years of Enlightenment and Adventure,
the only grade will be their own path of education from Middle-school to University,
all their curiosities combined together into a Hard Cover book,
that others may follow and improve upon in a Fellowship of Enlightenment.
Begin your journey with A Short History of Nearly Everything, by Bill Bryson,
leap to A People&apos;s History of the United States by Howard Zinn,
for light reading try What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe,
see if you can find a copy of The Giants of Philosophy Series read by Charlton Heston,
and look into The Teaching Company Lectures.
To make money, find a Start-up Accelerator similar to YCombinator near you,
and begin building Virtual Schools Online, borrow from Massively multiplayer online games.
Please don&apos;t be alone, but even if you do end up trying to save the world alone,
you will be in company of great beings, my Friend, and the future generations will stand upon your shoulders.
Here are some Starting Points, Thinkers and Scientists to get you started.

                  <span class="text-muted">For Humans, tragically,
it is either knowledge or conflict.
We come from warring tribes,
humanity has risen from war.
That rise came from,
increasing levels of knowledge.
The modern Human has been around for 200,000 years,
it is the knowledge that we inherit, and pass on, that helps us grow up.
If education is broken,
that that precious knowledge that sets us apart from warring tribes,
will become lost.
The knowledge is hard won, by many great beings,
Women and Men who sacrificed for Future Generations.
We are those generations,
and we must Honor the Philosophers, all the Humanity&apos;s Greatest Thinkers,
by inheriting from them and becoming Great Beings Too.
To fail, is to dishonor,
Humanity&apos;s most beautiful Hopes and Dreams.
Is to break countless hearts,
that date back thousands of years.
We are not that kind of creature.
We are Noble, and Loving, Exceptional,
and Infinitely Intelligent.
We must pay attention,
to the transfer of Knowledge and Wisdom between generations,
we must help the children to the books
The schools are failing,
whatever it is that they are doing,
disconnected facts, and blurry memories are nothing,
and they fail, they fail, and may actually cause harm.
Schools are making people think they are not intelligent enough,
but nothing could be further from the truth
Intelligent is exactly what we are,
we each have great Mental Powers.
Knowledge comes from books,
from lives of other people.
Off the top of our heads,
we will only remember 10 books,
when pressed more than a thousand.
If those books are not read,
if we go through schools, pretending to inherit knowledge.
The global level of knowledge will drop,
the Human Family will begin breaking up smaller,
equally misinformed groups
We will see a rise in nationalism, terrorism,
constant tensions, threats, and protests.
All these anomalies will be pointing away,
from World Peace, Our Dignity and Wisdom.
Imagine two soldiers, both are kids,
both were taught to kill each other by their teachers.
All Humans are equally intelligent,
all are capable of Indescribable Love and Infinite Creativity and Genius.
Their deadly difference,
is in their Knowledge.
And not just what they have been made to believe,
but also, and perhaps more importantly, the level of their knowledge.
The more we know, the more we grow,
the closer we come together.
If their nations granted them real knowledge,
there would be no conflict, no dying, no killing.
And not just Books, but the Recitations of their best Parts,
works of Vonnegut, Whitman, Neruda, Defoe, Melville, Bukowski,
Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Kant, Rand; Bryson, Tyson, and Hitch.
There would be no war,
we&apos;ve already had enough of war.
Education stopped filling us with Knowledge,
schools are pretending to teach now.
Perhaps it has always been the case,
but today, they aren&apos;t even trying.
What student&apos;s learn they learn on their own,
schools just provide the tests and entertainment.
We are more than this,
even though the Doctor may get their M.D.,
there may not be a world to practice in.
The threat of nuclear war has grown,
in the past 50 years the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife.
Just because some percentage of students are learning,
it does not mean that schools are working.
It takes more than a Doctor of a Lawyer,
it takes precisely 7,800,000,000 of well educated and reasonably informed people.
All it takes to get there is free access to audio versions of leading books,
where students can learn in privacy, in peace, and without the threat of shame.
School is fake,
it is not working.
Fake Education is tearing us apart,
pushing the world further into an unsustainable fantasy.
Let us help each other,
please, search the Public Domain for books that move you,
teach your self to narrate them, and share this beautiful art,
out of love, and for peace, and freedom, and for all the future generations to come.
Let us bring levels of knowledge up to where they should be,
we are better than this, we are smarter than this, we are greater than this.
School and education are cold and heartless words.
It is, love of life, and love of wisdom, and love of knowing,
and love of finding things out, and love of The Universe we live in.
Let us stop pretending that education is enough,
Knowledge, we must learn to stand in relentless pursuit of Knowledge,
our Greatest Adventure, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.
Education can make a Doctor,
but it is Knowledge and Wisdom that makes a Great Being.
Let us help the little ones to Knowledge and Wisdom,
so that their children are born to a Kinder, and More Compassionate, and Peaceful World.
A world most worthy of them.
Let us begin by reading, narrating or listening to World&apos;s most beloved non-fiction and adventure books.
For in the absence of real education,
we become the teachers.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Nowhere better can we connect with the Universe,
than that lost and lonely, lonesome dark.
I listened to the crickets, and the frogs,
I listened to the leaves, and waves.
And when the stars and the moon came out,
I&apos;d walk in the sunlight touched the moon.
Never have I been more lonely,
and never closer to Thoreau, Melville, Whitman and Defoe.
There was only one rule of Adventure,
if you see an Antique Store, you must shop, period.
That&apos;s where I found my ancient copy of Robinson Crusoe,
and I&apos;d read it from time to mime, I&apos;d listen to it as an Audio Book as well.
I found Dan Millman&apos;s Peacefull Warrior,
on a bottom shelf in a Dusty Box,
I read it from cover to cover in a single afternoon.
&quot;There are no ordinary moments.&quot;
Each year I went there,
strangers would look at me differently.
I was a Wizard of the Woods once - &quot;Thou shall pass&quot;,
I&apos;d holler stepping out of the way on that steep part of the Arrowhead trail.
Another year I was the Artsy Hobo, I built Driftwood Horses,
and adorn whatever I couldn&apos;t lift with colorful cats.
- I used up all my acrylics.
And early on I was the Raccoon Artist,
I&apos;d trace and sketch huge drawings of raccoons,
they were but a step away from becoming photo-realistic.
On my first long expedition,
I was greeted by a tired Park Ranger that didn&apos;t say a word.
On my way back, he realized I stayed the whole month,
and that it just happened to be the month of perfect sunshine for that year.
Even if it does rain there,
it is always warm rain that never gets in the way.
There was a couple of big storms,
that&apos;s true.
I remember laying on the ground in my tent, with an angry storm outside,
listing to We Are All Connected, by Symphony of Science,
and wondering about the conductivity of my tent poles.

                  <span class="text-muted">They were students, researching, thinking, learning,
they were not renowned scientists, they were just bored programmers looking for a challenge.
Something greater than mathematics, or algorithms, or languages,
they were looking for something more than any of their computers could simulate.
So they started programming,
programming a class of machines that could repair and rebuild themselves.
Really basic stuff, the machines would rely on,
whatever they could absorb from their environment.
They needed to survive indefinitely,
machines that could make machines, and repair, and renew.
A few milestones down the road,
they started thinking about practical applications.
They created tiny capsules that could be launched into already accelerated asteroids,
and even though the capsules were tiny, they had the ability to make countless copies,
and build bacterial colonies large enough to Terraform distant exo-planets.
Upon reaching a nearby stars,
capsules would disperse from forces of gravity and solar radiation.
Eventually land on the nearby exo-planets,
and begin executing their adaptation routine and create copies uniquely bound to the local chemistry.
The programmers setup a simple sequence of steps that would either induce early death,
or later reproduction, with pushing the more adapted information onto the offspring.
All because, there was nothing they could do to create something that would outlast time,
everything decays, we are all bombarded with radiation, protons and muons, and asteroids.
To create something lasting,
it would have to renew it self, rebuild adapt.
It would have to self assemble into colonies or microbiomes,
destroy the problematic, and promote the more adapted.
And spread, and grow, and continue adapting,
the DNA system was noisy enough to allow all kinds of variation.
There was nothing else that could work,
only cellular machinery could adapt without radio, soldering irons, without a forge, without tools,
without a source of heat even, without hands, or brains.
Getting the propulsion systems to work was just as amazing,
anything that whizzed by from small meteors to comets and large asteroids was infused with the capsules.
They even used lasers to accelerate some of the capsules to relativistic speeds,
the cells stored inside the capsules barely noticed any passage of time at all.
Eventually, everything that could sustain DNA based life,
was filled to the brim with it.
Comets, meteors, asteroids would further spread the little machines,
galaxies became cross-contaminated multiple times.
Life is everywhere,
and everywhen.
The Virgo Cluster did not receive the original genetic material,
we have evolved across countless solar systems and many galaxies.
The capsules contained a lot more than generic programming,
they contained instructions on how to establish an interface with it, and maintain it.
And they contained instructions,
on getting back Home, to Methuselah Prime.</span>
