                    <p>I dreamt I was tumbling through time,</p>
                    <p>and I had no control over which fragments I see.</p>

                    <p>There was a mother writing a letter to a famous movie star,</p>
                    <p>she was asking him to stop making movies, because her boy didn&apos;t comeback from war.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>And it worked,</p>
                    <p>and she wrote many letters.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>There was a lot of shocked artists and actors,</p>
                    <p>they had no idea how they shaped young impressionable minds.</p>

                    <p>Boys wanted to go to real war,</p>

                    <p>And then I struggled in my dream, because my bullies were clearly ill, they were not all there,</p>
                    <p>but World&apos;s Systems of Justice do not differentiate between the ill and the healthy.</p>

                    <p>is seen equal to a man of knowledge, insight, intelligence.</p>

                    <p>To punish someone who couldn&apos;t grow up, didn&apos;t know to learn,</p>
                    <p>for something that they weren&apos;t sure they were doing,</p>
                    <p>and then to send them to a hopeless place without a hope of healing,</p>
                    <p>without any hope of rehabilitation... is wrong.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Ability to connect with knowledge through audio-books,
and retain that knowledge, as your own,
and build on it to no end, is beyond the powers of Universe.
Inheriting Knowledge to build Wisdom makes you unstoppable,
and once you sit down to write a book of your own you become infinite.
We should not allow anyone to stand between us and our education,
inheritance of knowledge is extremely important to our mental health,
to how we treat each other, and how we interact with the world.
Books are the loveliest things in the world,
my time listening to &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson&quot; is such a wonderful memory.
I still smile at how shy Henry Cavendish was,
and sometimes I worry about a Kimberlite Pipes popping up somewhere nearby, you never know.
The part where Conway Morris muttered &quot;...not another phylum.&quot;,
got me when I was jogging in the middle of the night at Ann Arbor, MI,
I almost suffocated from laughter.
See a school can&apos;t present knowledge this way,
I know that there are many amazing professors,
but most of them, probably have a fantastic book or series or lectures out.
Knowledge has to be presented with Love and Joy, and maybe a hint of Comedy,
schools of today are coldhearted machines incapable of those emotions.
We can&apos;t just pass the tests that schools expect us to cram for,
we need the actual knowledge, and wonders that will help us become wise.
Life is always asking us to pick a direction,
the wiser we become early on, the happier we will be on the paths we chose.
We must not become tricked into believing we are bad at learning,
there is just no such thing as bad at learning.
Bad grades just prove that middle-school, high-school and college are seriously broken,
the kids that do get good grades and become successful learn outside of school,
and they certainly do not cram before tests they actually learn.
Learning and Schools should not be two separate things,
and there should never be a threat of someone becoming tricked into thinking that they are not smart.
This is a global problem,
the leaders and policy makes who did cram for tests,
they too need a real education that will contribute to their wisdom.
This is not just about fixing High School,
this is about helping Humanity Grow in Wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">A new age is coming,
an age where the younger generations will end tolerance of blind mistakes.
There will be no more business as usual,
for there was never a usual to be had.
The children can see that borders are hurting the world,
political, cultural, and religious borders keep humanity divided and weak.
The only reason for their tolerance of our mistakes today,
is that they still believe in us, they still think we have the answers they are looking for.
But with internet, and disasters, climate change, and continued threats of nuclear war,
more and more children learn to see that Humanity cannot grow as it is today.
They are the future,
and it is their future.
The revolution will be silent,
there will be no battle, they will just wait us out.
They didn&apos;t even need us to do anything special,
just end their poverty, and give them real schools.
They will watch the videos of us helplessly bailing out corruption,
spouting nonsense about how poverty can&apos;t be fixed, because that&apos;s not how money works.
All the way down,
until all markets collapse to nothing.
This is not a poem about Global Warming and Economic Collapse,
this is a poem about Naked Emperors, and Authenticity.
This is a poem about Real Schools,
that make a real difference for all the kids, most of which still look up to us.
Elementary school is working,
it is perfect, and those teachers are still The Cheerful Heroes they have always been.
Middle School, breaks down under fake education,
as we fail to teach tools for thinking, and sell our children for a small paycheck.
High School, is where the kids figure out it is all fake,
and come home with bad grades to call you out.
College and University,
finally manages to break their beautiful hearts.
Open curriculum, brand name education, networking with the past graduates, lose leaf text books,
debt, and sweet infantile dean feeling shy for wearing the school brand underwear, that one last day of the semester.
That was not a graduation speech old man, that was pain and fear,
that was the declaration that the Emperor is Naked.
The best of the kids who do go through the process,
learn that the can but help a person, a village, but there is no way for them to help the whole world.
Jumping all the hoops does not provide the solutions the entire world needs,
we have to have faith in the future generations enabled by real education, that is our only hope.
Give the kids a school, that will teach them for real,
while there is still a better future to be had.
A school that is worthy of the Infinitely Creative Genius that they really are,
stop pushing them through the mockery of education that removes their unique connection to Knowledge,
and replaces it with Memorization and Fake Grades
Each Human Being has a unique way of connecting with Knowledge and Wisdom,
and every one of those ways has a path that moves at a perfect pace-and-sequence through the sciences.
It can be music, and then Alan Walker, and lmms, and a cover of Alone,
and then the world of programming, and mathematics and signal processing.
It can be Games, Graphics, Game Design, Trigonometry,
Astrophysics, and Orbital Dynamics, and Astrobiology.
It can be Art, a tin of pencils, and a classroom of students,
and inspiration, and speaking, and internship at the UN, and finally Presidency.
It can be Adventure, and bugs, and Photography,
and Film Making, and the Documentary that helps Earth awake in time.
Their paths are much shorter then the ones that strip them off their natural predispositions,
and confine them into rows like slaves,
and cut up knowledge into preached cubes void of sense,
and slow them down to a crawl by presenting incomprehensible lectures,
and memorization games for nothing.
That stupid pointless aim, to keep getting funding,
and pay the staff, so that everyone keeps their crappy jobs,
at the price of the future, and the best minds of our generation.
The result of this madness,
is children losing faith in their own Genius,
and in the Power of Education, and Knowledge and Wisdom.
This is where whoever is left,
that still has strength left,
needs to step in.
Help them regain the belief that they are geniuses,
and that we are all equally gifted.
Help them to Audio Books,
because schools are now hurting them.
Do not let the Little Ones,
give up on their Genius.
We are all gifted, we are all geniuses,
we must all comprehend the world&apos;s leading science books.
We must all grow in Authenticity, in Dignity,
in Insight and Foresight.
For All The Future...

Each student will mark their own trail with their own curiosities,

Education will be life long,

There will be less potential for war,
Humanity will converge on the same body of good ideas.

                  <span class="text-muted">The simplest, most resilient, tested and lasting unit of information,
that can transfer large amounts of knowledge between Human Beings, is a book.
Reading a raw book is like eating soup from a can,
it is very nutritious, it tastes OK, it is fine, but there is a better way.
To improve a book we can use a capable narrator to read it, and record it,
creating an audio book that we can bring with us on an adventure.
For example, we can pack a day pack and go to a nearby State Park with long winding trails,
along the way we can relax, enjoy the season, the atmosphere, and learn.
Combining a Nature Walk with the Audio Book version,
reveals the original paper book for what it really is.
A paper book is about long term storage of ideas that can be archived for ages,
and enjoyed for hundreds if not thousands of years.
A book should be decoded from text to audio,
only then can we fully process the ideas that the author wants to share.
To back up this claim, think of a Business asking employees to read a particular book,
would it not be much better to help the employees to a day off an gift them a well narrated audio version?
A good book is more than just a thing to be read line by line,
a book not only contains ideas and tools for thinking but also the author at the time of writing.
To read a book for real, we really have to hear the author speak,
we have to be able to feel their Soul, Heart, and Spirit.
Should the author prove worthy we should become friends with them across space and time,
perhaps even make them part of our extended family and put their photo near or on the Fireplace Mantel.
A good book, is a book that makes us a better person by transferring some hard earned wisdom,
a kind of timeless love, that helps the world to become a wiser and better place.
Much of the World is still divided by imaginary borders,
the division relies on political, religious and cultural indoctrination presenting a subset of reality, if not warping it entirely.
Making wisdom more accessible, especially to young people who learn the fastest and are about to face challenges previously unseen,
is more than just a good idea, it is our moral duty.
I ask all the companies who hold the ability to release meaningful audio-books to students, to do so, right now,
we should not hope to make money by restricting or impeding access to knowledge,
not to the generation that now faces the problems we were unable to stop ourselves from propagating.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">My Friends,
In this letter I ask you to begin working on building the schools we wish we had,
by means of creating free and open audio and video lectures.
I am asking you to study what you love, to learn and master what moves your heart,
and improve and refine the notes and materials until the audio/video recordings can lead a lecture worthy of your students.
I am asking you to rise to the Great Challenge of becoming Real Teachers,
so that you may help the Younger Generations out of Love, and Inspiration, and Wisdom.
The problems of Mass Incarceration, Climate Change, and Voter Confusion,
are rooted in the broken systems of education that we see today.
By enabling the new generation of students,
we will help them with the challenges they will soon face.
We are going to replace schools and broken/fake education,
with the lectures we upload to the internet, together.
Wherever possible, work in groups,
so that no one Great Being must carry the weight of this Great Challenge alone.
I want you to work together, so that the students who will use your materials,
will fell your friendship and love, hear your laughter, your authenticity, and heroism.
Schools begun hurting the world by misleading children,
and pushing them into the false belief that they are not smart enough for good grades.
The truth is that all children are geniuses,
as Humans, we are all equally gifted.
However, we all too easily accept authority without question,
and all too easily fail to perceive reality warped by cultural indoctrination.
Let us begin our work, in the beginning,
starting where Elementary School ends and Middle School Begins.
This is the point where education becomes a charade of memorization, grades, and standardized testing,
this is where we divide Human Knowledge into categories that lose their meaning and purpose.
Let us build our lectures, baby step by baby step,
following simple human curiosity that lies behind so many of our greatest achievements.
The task at hand is simple,
but also enormous.
The more join us under the banner of Free and Open Lectures,
the easier the path to the Real Solutions and Real Results that the future generations require.
Let us build a school in the Public Domain,
a school that invites all to learn from Audio, Video and Digital Materials.
A school where there are no grades,
only visible paths and milestones of proud achievements and joy of learning.
Let us encourage all the participants to expand the lectures under no subject in particular,
simply what makes best sense for the Human Mind to Grasp.
Let us tile our lecture for what they really are,
and may they unite many of the old subjects, so that they may be once again be free of borders and overflowing with content.
The world of the future requires real solutions with lasting results to very complex problems,
let us help the children of today meet that challenge in Knowledge and Wisdom.</span>
