                      <p>he will shed the patina of isolation, he will force himself to inherit modern culture and lifetimes from books,</p>
                      <p>and genius will return, it will be fresh, raw, reignited, he may for a moment become the wisest being on earth.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Sometimes writing journals becomes a chore,
because page after page the darn thing begs for more.
Slowly it becomes a bore,
and so as we grow, writing turns into a thing of yore.
I think, writing poetry is the best,
as here your language takes you on a little quest.
You can write very little and even in jest,
and it still comes out with grrrreat zest.
Moreover,
many do not wish to read long pages,
as getting to the end would take them whooooole ages.
And, some may wish to read your thing twice,
or may even wish to enjoy it thrice.
And here brevity is king,
short little things are just the thing.
So if it has been a long time since you writ,
dig up your journal and lay down some fancy wit.
And if you never wrote before, you&apos;re in luck,
lookup word families or find a a rhyming dictionary, and pluck!</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each lesson must add to the next one,
we hardly need to push ourselves.
It sooo important that you start with something you like,
it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.
There area always extras that come alongside,
and they change everything.
Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,
maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.
Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,
you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.
I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,
but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.
Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,
it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.
A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,
sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.
One example that comes to mind is the Ohm&apos;s Law,
you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.
Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,
you can&apos;t connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.
So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,
then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.
Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,
you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.
You see what the problem is, of course,
in schools, they don&apos;t teach by means of practical applications.
They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,
which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.
If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,
and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.
But they don&apos;t do that,
we have to do that.
And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,
it is all those little things we are interested in.
And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,
they won&apos;t know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.
See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,
so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.
And then come our retirement, we&apos;ll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,
and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.
It is the only way the world can grow,
and there is much growing up ahead of us.

                  <span class="text-muted">That is the law, above all laws,
that is the rule above all rules.
That is the advice, above all advice,
that is the last sacred wisdom.
The adults can have whatever they want, and a full measure of happiness,
so as long as it does not interfere with your rise to greatness.
Whatever stands in your way, gods, royalty, governments and armies, laws,
traditions, parents, friends, schools, fairy tales, and curfews.
Is null and void,
by the power of the Universe, by the power of Reality.
Do you hear me?
all that matters is that you become a Great Being and Help Humanity Grow.
And armies will come to twist and lie, deport and enslave,
warp and punish, judge and sentence.
But they do not fight you,
they fight reality.
Those who fight reality,
can only destroy themselves.
You, you begin,
by inheriting reason and wisdom.
Whether you rise in camps, prisons or battles,
school libraries, or by shouting poems at the cafeteria.
Wisdom is the first and foremost,
and what must follow; is your rise to greatness.
Do not fear armies that are marching towards sure self-destruction,
instead Honor Humanity by becoming a Great Being.
And when you, reach your golden age,
remove that which stands in the way of the generations that are to follow.
Because, the world belongs to the children,
and the generations that are yet to come.
You must rise to Greatness,
by whatever means fit you best.</span>

the world becomes a darker place.
The bad people are sick and broken,
they only have as much power as you give them.
The more you grow in strength,
the weaker, they become.
Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,
we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.
The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,
the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.
The bad people are only broken children, they can&apos;t grow,
they do not know that a Human, can only rise, when hurt.
Humans are born warriors,
our minds were forged in battle.
We are also philosophers,
each of our hardships, becomes a breathtaking page in our memoir.
No ache, ever goes wasted,
it becomes sacred and inspired wisdom to help others rise.
The only way for Humanity to grow,
is for each and every Human to become a Great Being.
Your struggles are a call to Heroism,
become a teacher, and help Humanity learn.
Greatness, is the new adulthood,
Greatness, is Humanity&apos;s Health.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">When you think about life decade by decade,
you can see that it is best lived by following an upward slope.
Each decade should be powerful for us,
it should propel us forward and beyond.
We must really take the time to consider what is important,
what is it that our elder selves may regret not having done.
Life does come with an instruction manual,
it is all the Audio Books that will interest you.
From Memoirs, to Adventure, and Science,
and also reading in-between the lines.
Above all, we must take good care of ourselves,
life is not meant to be lived in stress, or fear, or at a great speed.
This is how we can understand those books,
and learn from them and inherit their wisdom.
We are each a miracle of the universe,
the GPA, the championship or scholarship, just does not matter.
Listen to those words,
IT DOES NOT MATTER!
Because you are already more,
than any of that made up stuff!
It is not the brand of education that matters,
what matters, is that your education, brought you wisdom!
With wisdom, if you still need to,
you will build your own Firm, or Company, or School.
Pursuit of Wisdom, guarantees that as each decade passes,
you will grow in Greatness.
With Wisdom, and the transcendence of limits it entails,
come our golden age, we will become far more, than we thought possible.
The most prestigious degree, is the honorary degree,
where a University goes out of its way to deliver it to you,
for all your achievements, and the goodness you brought to the World.</span>
