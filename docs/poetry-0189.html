                  The software we speak of in context of Politics,
                  are the Noble and Mature Minds of Human Beings.
                  We can all imagine a computer with low quality workmanship,
                  with misbehaving components, with overwhelmed electronics.
                  This is similar to how Politics work,
                  deliberately miseducated voters, overworked employees made to vote,
                  can cause a Political System to misbehave.
                  ---
                  Let us not overburden this analogy,
                  comparing Computer Systems and Political Systems,
                  should just begin a conversation.
                  ---
                  Let us ask if we can have fully functional Justice Systems,
                  when our Education and Welfare Systems have failed,
                  and poverty now forces people into,
                  self medication, addiction, abuse, theft, and crime.
                  The answer is no.
                  We cannot have a Justice System, that fully executes its orders,
                  when its surrounding systems have failed,
                  this creates a mechanic that was not intended,
                  people are forced into a life of crime,
                  and then forced into prisons.
                  ---
                  Let us imagine an Evil Actor,
                  one that wishes to place as many people as possible in prison,
                  the best way to create a mechanic that causes this,
                  is to force people into poverty, deny them education, cause them stress,
                  and as a result we would likely witness,
                  self medication, addiction, abuse, theft, and crime, among other things.
                  ---
                  People are not evil, they are Noble and Dignified,
                  but people can be made sick with fear, fright, hunger, cold, dankness, pain.
                  When given an opportunity,
                  people will take the first available exit,
                  just to save themselves, it matters not it is intentional, or instinctual.
                  When bad things happen,
                  we take the shortest paths for maximum survival.
                  ---
                  A justice system that has no ability to perceive walking a path towards survival can only fill prisons.
                  There may not be a way to &quot;write&quot; a &quot;software program&quot; that has the ability to perceive this complexity of life.
                  ---
                  But we are not helpless and brainless cogs, whose only solution is the creation of more cogs.
                  ---
                  We have a great power,
                  the power of Shaping the Future of Our Existence.
                  The name of this power is:
                  Prevention.
                  ---
                  We can build a fully functional Justice System,
                  that is Beautiful, Small, Lightweight and Simple.
                  So as long as we practice, in full, Crime Prevention,
                  that is, we address, in full, all the issues connected to:
                  Fear, fright, hunger, cold, dankness, pain, and the resulting
                  self medication, addiction, abuse, theft, to name a few.
                  This list should also include issues relating to [Human Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)
                  ---
                  Systems require that all their components are up-to-date,
                  fully functional, function at their best, and at their most.
                  If some part is broken, or breaking, or lacking, then all the rest will fail.
                  ---
                  Please, please note that Great Political Systems are often born in the Minds and Hearts of Great Beings,
                  leaders, with great many followers that die for those ideas.
                  No one should ever lay down their life, nor endanger the life of another, for a Leader, or an Idea,
                  but this happens, because we are a growing civilization, and we want to grow.
                  We have to honor all that have perished,
                  all who were inspired, all who died misinformed, everyone,
                  as Human Life is Beyond Sacred, and must be lived in a considerable part in Happiness.
                  Mistakes happen, when civilizations grow,
                  and those mistakes cause incomprehensible sadness and harm.
                  ---
                  We must continue moving towards a Humanity United on Good Ideas,
                  so that there will be no more fighting.
                  In order to Unite,
                  we will need Fully Functional Political Systems across the entire globe.
                  ---
                  Unification is a Noble Task that the Future Generations will take great pride in.
                  They need help, they need us to begin by learning more.
                  By the practice of daily Acquisition of Knowledge, and Self Education.
                  By our constant motion towards tipping points that will have us eventually reach Wisdom.
                  By using that wisdom to Build and Support, Outstanding Political Systems.
                  ---
                  This is a multi-generational project,
                  that may take several centuries.
                  The world of the future faces great issues.
                  Many of those issues are rooted in us having become tricked that we are not smart enough to learn.
                  That we are not Leaders but just along for a ride.
                  That the government is some kind of an external system, that only makes us do things.
                  This is all just an illusion.
                  ---
                  Above all we are all Sisters and Brothers, we are one Family, one People.
                  We are all geniuses, powerfully intelligent, though this requires life long learning, self education.
                  We are all, Extremely Strong,and the strength of a Wise and United Humanity is simply indescribable.
                  ---
                  We don&apos;t really have a flaw,
                  but we do get ill without knowledge, or when tricked into believing fantasies of falsehoods, or propaganda,
                  we require healthy knowledge that helps us move towards good ideas and wisdom.
                  Getting sick is not a flaw,
                  it is just something that needs to be Prevented or Treated.
                  The system of education was supposed to help with acquisition of knowledge,
                  onward to guiding people towards becoming enlightened and wise.
                  These enlightened and wise individuals,
                  were to ensure an exit out of poverty and air starts for all.
                  Then Justice system was to correct mistakes,
                  in meaningful ways that helped Humanity Grow.
                  ---
                  But we are not learning,
                  and all the Hopes and Dreams are being delayed,
                  and some of the systems that were to come in last,
                  are fully functional, spinning out of control,
                  and actually causing harm, in the worst way, by tearing families apart.
                  ---
                  We have to balance the systems out,
                  until all are fully functional.
                  For example,
                  we need to practice Preferential Treatment for those Fractured by Poverty,
                  this is a temporary measure aimed at not sending people who did not have a fair start to prison.
                  A more complex example,
                  is Closing all Prisons, and replacing them with Hospitals.
                  Recognizing that people get ill and that very bad people are very sick in deed,
                  but that they are to be helped and not kept in cages as revenge and to cause them even more pain.
                  ---
                  Wisdom.
                  We need a Wiser Humanity,
                  we need to become more knowledgeable,
                  more aware.
                  We need to learn to use our financial systems to benefit Humanity,
                  and keep a world hostage by means of poverty.
                  These ideas may seem as outrageous today,
                  as a Space Shuttle might have seemed outrageous in Dark Ages,
                  as outrageous as non-existence of Ice Giants felt to the Vikings.
                  ---
                  Knowledge, will correct that outrage,
                  Wisdom, will help Humanity Grow.
                  ---
                  It all begins with you,
                  and your adventure into the world of Video Lectures and Audio Books.
                  There is no instructor, there is no specific subject or divisions thereof,
                  begin reading books that make you smile, that move you.
                  For the world to grow,
                  every human being must become a Connoisseur of Knowledge, and a Great Lover of Wisdom.
                  By enjoying having books read to us,
                  and becoming powerful with knowledge, enlightened with joy, and empowered by wisdom.
                  We help the next generation to a better start,
                  we help them inherit great many wisdom from us,
                  and start much higher than we did.
                  Let us make a Wise Humanity, or World Peace, or World United our aim,
                  it matters not which,
                  simply focus helping children grow faster, and wiser,
                  and not forgetting the lessons we learned from the generations that came before us.
                  ---
                  Let us be mindful that for multiple consecutive generations to move towards the same aim,
                  the aim must exceptional, permanent.
                  Any nation that selects a temporary aim,
                  an aim that will derail their future generations,
                  will fall like a house of cards.
                  That is Reality,
                  that is how the Universe works.
                  If the aim is not there,
                  when the future generations arrive,
                  they will reach nothing.
                  There are no aims, other than those that are Authentic and Noble.
                  We cannot help but to move towards, Reality.
                  ---
                  In the Future,
                  no Human Being will be kept in a cage as revenge,
                  for something they have done out of the fractures that poverty caused to their mind.
                  In the Future,
                  money will not be used to keep families overworked and stressed,
                  families will have a Home, and Food, and their children will be happy, and they will grow up surrounded by wise ideas.
                  In the Future,
                  people will have to face the damage we have caused to our planet,
                  they will see us in a forgiving light, they will see that we were not educated enough to act and to help them.
                  In the Future,

the power of Shaping the Future of Our Existence.
The name of this power is:
Prevention.
---
We can build a fully functional Justice System,
that is Beautiful, Small, Lightweight and Simple.
So as long as we practice, in full, Crime Prevention,
that is, we address, in full, all the issues connected to:
Fear, fright, hunger, cold, dankness, pain, and the resulting
self medication, addiction, abuse, theft, to name a few.
This list should also include issues relating to [Human Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)
---
Systems require that all their components are up-to-date,
fully functional, function at their best, and at their most.
If some part is broken, or breaking, or lacking, then all the rest will fail.
---
Please, please note that Great Political Systems are often born in the Minds and Hearts of Great Beings,
leaders, with great many followers that die for those ideas.
No one should ever lay down their life, nor endanger the life of another, for a Leader, or an Idea,
but this happens, because we are a growing civilization, and we want to grow.
We have to honor all that have perished,
all who were inspired, all who died misinformed, everyone,
as Human Life is Beyond Sacred, and must be lived in a considerable part in Happiness.
Mistakes happen, when civilizations grow,
and those mistakes cause incomprehensible sadness and harm.
---
We must continue moving towards a Humanity United on Good Ideas,
so that there will be no more fighting.
In order to Unite,
we will need Fully Functional Political Systems across the entire globe.
---
Unification is a Noble Task that the Future Generations will take great pride in.
They need help, they need us to begin by learning more.
By the practice of daily Acquisition of Knowledge, and Self Education.
By our constant motion towards tipping points that will have us eventually reach Wisdom.
By using that wisdom to Build and Support, Outstanding Political Systems.
---
This is a multi-generational project,
that may take several centuries.
The world of the future faces great issues.
Many of those issues are rooted in us having become tricked that we are not smart enough to learn.
That we are not Leaders but just along for a ride.
That the government is some kind of an external system, that only makes us do things.
This is all just an illusion.
---
Above all we are all Sisters and Brothers, we are one Family, one People.
We are all geniuses, powerfully intelligent, though this requires life long learning, self education.
We are all, Extremely Strong,and  the strength of a Wise and United Humanity is simply indescribable.
---
We don&apos;t really have a flaw,
but we do get ill without knowledge, or when tricked into believing fantasies of falsehoods, or propaganda,
we require healthy knowledge that helps us move towards good ideas and wisdom.
Getting sick is not a flaw,
it is just something that needs to be Prevented or Treated.
The system of education was supposed to help with acquisition of knowledge,
onward to guiding people towards becoming enlightened and wise.
These enlightened and wise individuals,
were to ensure an exit out of poverty and air starts for all.
Then Justice system was to correct mistakes,
in meaningful ways that helped Humanity Grow.
---
But we are not learning,
and all the Hopes and Dreams are being delayed,
and some of the systems that were to come in last,
are fully functional, spinning out of control,
and actually causing harm, in the worst way, by tearing families apart.
---
We have to balance the systems out,
until all are fully functional.
For example,
we need to practice Preferential Treatment for those Fractured by Poverty,
this is a temporary measure aimed at not sending people who did not have a fair start to prison.
A more complex example,
is Closing all Prisons, and replacing them with Hospitals.
Recognizing that people get ill and that very bad people are very sick in deed,
but that they are to be helped and not kept in cages as revenge and to cause them even more pain.
---
Wisdom.
We need a Wiser Humanity,
we need to become more knowledgeable,
more aware.
We need to learn to use our financial systems to benefit Humanity,
and keep a world hostage by means of poverty.
These ideas may seem as outrageous today,
as a Space Shuttle might have seemed outrageous in Dark Ages,
as outrageous as non-existence of Ice Giants felt to the Vikings.
---
Knowledge, will correct that outrage,
Wisdom, will help Humanity Grow.
---
It all begins with you,
and your adventure into the world of Video Lectures and Audio Books.
There is no instructor, there is no specific subject or divisions thereof,
begin reading books that make you smile, that move you.
For the world to grow,
every human being must become a Connoisseur of Knowledge, and a Great Lover of Wisdom.
By enjoying having books read to us,
and becoming powerful with knowledge, enlightened with joy, and empowered by wisdom.
We help the next generation to a better start,
we help them inherit great many wisdom from us,
and start much higher than we did.
Let us make a Wise Humanity, or World Peace, or World United our aim,
it matters not which,
simply focus helping children grow faster, and wiser,
and not forgetting the lessons we learned from the generations that came before us.
---
Let us be mindful that for multiple consecutive generations to move towards the same aim,
the aim must exceptional, permanent.
Any nation that selects a temporary aim,
an aim that will derail their future generations,
will fall like a house of cards.
That is Reality,
that is how the Universe works.
If the aim is not there,
when the future generations arrive,
they will reach nothing.
There are no aims, other than those that are Authentic and Noble.
We cannot help but to move towards, Reality.
---
In the Future,
no Human Being will be kept in a cage as revenge,
for something they have done out of the fractures that poverty caused to their mind.
In the Future,
money will not be used to keep families overworked and stressed,
families will have a Home, and Food, and their children will be happy, and they will grow up surrounded by wise ideas.
In the Future,
people will have to face the damage we have caused to our planet,
they will see us in a forgiving light, they will see that we were not educated enough to act and to help them.
In the Future,</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Let the deans nod to the graduates that drink most coffee,
sitting with presidents and dignitaries,
let them smile that each passed their trial.
But you, Dear Mother, you take your child to the Library,
make it their Castle, make it their Home,
make it their Temple of Knowledge.
&quot;My Mother used to bring me here almost every day,
this is my Temple of Knowledge, this is my Forever Home.&quot;
Teach that non-fiction, especially Memoirs,
are the only safe way to grow up.
Keep them on a path to understanding of the simplest things first,
and the most important things second so that they may build an easy on-ramp for themselves.
Remind them, that all young mistakes have already been made countless times,
that all the lessons, answers, and hopes of prevention,
are to be found in sacred stories of Triumph and Disaster.
That there is little in blind following.
And that there is Everything in pursuit of Wisdom,
to join with the Greater Family of the Great Human Beings,
that came before us and are sure to follow.
That school is just a Dream,
of a Simpler Universe,
a melody sweetly played,
but not in tune.
That our mind at its most responsible,
is the Sole Institution that we require,
for Pursuits of Excellence and Higher Learning.
So as long as we love ourselves,
as long as we are compassionate to ourselves,
we can comprehend inside out, many times the knowledge,
of those who are taught, outside in.
Let the Temple of Knowledge,
shine its beacon and sound the bell,
each time the little ones need answers,
and each time they are ready to commit their own wisdom to History.
World Peace requires,
that each child today,
becomes a Great Being,
in the Greater Tomorrow.
World Peace has little to do with the unobtainable ceasefire today,
and has everything to do, with letting children grow up under blue skies,
without drone strikes, deafening echoes of explosions, bullet riddled walls, and detention camps.
May the Greatness of Your Vision, and Unbreakability of your Heart and Mind,
help the Unstoppable Children of today, become the Great Beings the Future Needs.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We have to remind each other,
that change requires,
that you and I grow.
That we grow in strength,
that we grow in experience.
that we grow in knowledge.
That we grow in Wisdom,
that we grow in Foresight.
That we grow all the way up.
We can&apos;t afford expensive Universities,
we don&apos;t even have the time.
We don&apos;t really want to graduate from Brown,
or Harvard, or Yale.
What we really want, is to spend a semester at each,
and for our hard earned wisdom to count as much as their Curriculum and GPA.
It would be nice to give a graduation speech,
though, it wouldn&apos;t last for very long,
everyone is so busy on that day.
And what a drop in the ocean,
a few years will seem come our Golden Age of Wisdom.
We have to be heard, BEYOND, a mere graduation speech,
and we have to learn FAR BEYOND anything a class can teach us.
We can&apos;t afford to be students, not for a year, not for a day,
because we are born at a gallop, and onward; to become an unstoppable force of Nature,
AND CHANGE, Meaningful Change.
That means, your little High School poetry book,
makes it into the back pocket of Every High School Troublemaker and Dropout.
And they will rely on your Down To Earth Greatness, and Your Unlimited, Unconfined, Hard Earned Wisdom,
to get through their nights, and to cross to the hills,
and to begin their Unlimited Journey to Their Mountain Tops.
There isn&apos;t time for classroom experience,
there is only time for Wisdom, Love and a Meaningful Contributions.
Every new intellectual,
each new dreamer, poet, writer or orator hoping to help the world grow,
needs a far greater audience, and a greater runway for a greater wisdom,
than any University can provide.
The changes cannot come from the Policy Makers, or Impressive Dignitaries, or Inspired Professors,
they can only come form deep within each and every Human Being alive today, and all those that are yet to come,
standing - on their own - in relentless pursuit of Excellence and Wisdom, not Grades, or Prestige.
We don&apos;t need more laws, more prisons, talking heads, and deans,
we need to take to the audio books, video lectures, the internet,
and learn at a speed far greater than any curriculum can offer.
Begin recording your first audio book,
listen to what you know,
and where you need to know more.
Pull yourself up by your own shoelaces,
let Unrestrained Education take over.
Wisdom graded by the lives you touch,
by the disasters you avert,
by the wisdom you share.
Let us set fairy tales aside,
and let us accept responsibility for our own education.
And encouraging all we meet to do the same,
there can not be a greater Brand Name,
than a Wise Humanity.
The world needs our help,
it is a call far beyond what Universities can point us towards to.
The world needs all... the Humans to Graduate.
From the upcoming politicians with their over-inflated campaigns,
and research that relies on low education and short foresight of the voter.
To those of us, who didn&apos;t want to go to MIT, or Harvard,
because we felt it only hold us back, if not downright break our heart.
Universities are little promises meant for a smaller and happier world,
the world of today is far too big to be moved by mere graduates,
even if it was all the universities trying all at once.
Every Human Being requires an Outstanding Education,
one that empowers them to stand up against all the wrong in the world today.
With the light of Intellectual Inheritance worthy of The Noblest Independent Human,
and the light they themselves bring to the world come their Golden Age of Wisdom.
My Dear Reader,
may you learn, and piece together so much wisdom,
as to ignite a light so powerful that each and every child in the word,
from across all political borders and language barriers will visit you and listen,
and grow in wisdom with your lesson and enlightenment.
Let us part part with the idea of an exclusive University and brand name education (whatever that is),
and take to every book worthy of each of us,
and learn more, and faster,
and greater lessons than can be taught outside in.
Because today&apos;s challenges are greater than the solutions that anyone in particular can bring,
the solution is in all of us, reaching and mastering knowledge and wisdom one by one.
The Protection of The Younger Generations from War, Poverty and Greed,
is the first and foremost, and must come as a result of a Wiser Humanity.
World Peace, and Human Rights,
are close second.
The Human Mind and Life is Too Sacred,
for little fairy tales of exclusive education.
Do not wait to be taught,
learn, and learn to no end in sight,
and when you know enough, share; and teach.
And may each Human Being,
grow to know that Wisdom, Growing All The Way Up, Greatness,
is neither optional, nor meant for the lucky few.
Let us accept the responsibility for Outstanding Self Education,
because for the world to grow; it is either all of us, or none.</span>

and where life is very, very, very, very, long.
As it winds along the well worn paths like a little song,
and where there is always a right, that can fix a wrong.
And we are hardly ever alone, so as long as we stand strong,
and you can achieve anything so as long as your effort is lifelong.
Many others traveled all these sandy roads,
many handled much more weight and greater workloads.
But it really all revolves about how much you learn, love, and know,
that&apos;s what helps you get unstuck from that rainy office window.
We don&apos;t have to ride every crazy rodeo,
live beneath an angry grumbling volcano.
Run as if chased by herds of stampeding buffalo,
and like every corner hides a foe.
Beautifully... it is best to live life slow,
in tune with crickets, starry nights, frogs and rain, sunshine, and snow.
Live so slow as to have time to learn, think, and write,
to share with others all that you found to be lovely and bright.
And not knowing what to write about, is the best,
because that means Nordhouse is calling you, to a little quest.
And when you return, you will have to find a warm and cozy nook,
grab a mug of chocolate and let your poems flow into your litte book.
Yup, you may need to pack a back pack, and give it a go,
remember, life is longest, when you live it slow.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">When you gather a comfortable amount of observation,
there is a moment when you go from observer to creator.
It is similar to how you arrive in a new city,
at first you are unsure, but eventually it becomes your home town.
In politics, politicians so through something similar,
but it is a mistake, they become comfortable around manipulators,
and get comfortable with manipulating, propagating the blight.
In the world of books, the authors that resonate with you,
become your friends, Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Dan Brown,
they become family and you get to know them in your own way.
In world adventures, it is called going native, or emanating mana,
one moment you are an outsider, and the next you are riding a bull to work,
where you spend your days working hard on digging new wells,
hurrying to finish before your visa expires and you have get back to the loud and filthy city.
When knowledge becomes internalized, it becomes wisdom,
you become able to synthesize more knowledge out of what you already know,
some call it Enlightenment.
It all cases, it is natural, human, simple and easy to get to,
it is not rare, it is not a power granted only to special people,
it is a power that makes people more special.
If you read enough audio books that move you in the same direction,
you&apos;ll go from listening about something to becoming a participant in thinking about it.
It is a feeling so powerful at first,
that some become convinced they are geniuses,
and have deeper knowledge
&quot;Nope! that&apos;s just your first tipping point dude,
keep going though, because you are just about as amazing as you think you are, don&apos;t stop learning&quot;.
The more tipping points, and plateaus,
upon which we rests as we move towards the sunny parts of our mountain range.
The more capable we become, the more we can synthesize,
and the more of the things we synthesize slowly do become unique and amazing.
Finally, the more we know,
the easier it is to understand other people&apos;s works,
we begin sharing more and more with other creators.
That&apos;s Real Education,
we become specialists in our own unique corners of the world,
Eventually we too get stung by the urge to share what we know,
both the unique little discoveries or contributions we made,
and in memoirs that describe all the twisty little passages that got us there.</span>
