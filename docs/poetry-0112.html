                  <span class="text-muted">Nowhere better can we connect with the Universe,
than that lost and lonely, lonesome dark.
I listened to the crickets, and the frogs,
I listened to the leaves, and waves.
And when the stars and the moon came out,
I&apos;d walk in the sunlight touched the moon.
Never have I been more lonely,
and never closer to Thoreau, Melville, Whitman and Defoe.
There was only one rule of Adventure,
if you see an Antique Store, you must shop, period.
That&apos;s where I found my ancient copy of Robinson Crusoe,
and I&apos;d read it from time to mime, I&apos;d listen to it as an Audio Book as well.
I found Dan Millman&apos;s Peacefull Warrior,
on a bottom shelf in a Dusty Box,
I read it from cover to cover in a single afternoon.
&quot;There are no ordinary moments.&quot;
Each year I went there,
strangers would look at me differently.
I was a Wizard of the Woods once - &quot;Thou shall pass&quot;,
I&apos;d holler stepping out of the way on that steep part of the Arrowhead trail.
Another year I was the Artsy Hobo, I built Driftwood Horses,
and adorn whatever I couldn&apos;t lift with colorful cats.
- I used up all my acrylics.
And early on I was the Raccoon Artist,
I&apos;d trace and sketch huge drawings of raccoons,
they were but a step away from becoming photo-realistic.
On my first long expedition,
I was greeted by a tired Park Ranger that didn&apos;t say a word.
On my way back, he realized I stayed the whole month,
and that it just happened to be the month of perfect sunshine for that year.
Even if it does rain there,
it is always warm rain that never gets in the way.
There was a couple of big storms,
that&apos;s true.
I remember laying on the ground in my tent, with an angry storm outside,
listing to We Are All Connected, by Symphony of Science,
and wondering about the conductivity of my tent poles.

                  <span class="text-muted">They were students, researching, thinking, learning,
they were not renowned scientists, they were just bored programmers looking for a challenge.
Something greater than mathematics, or algorithms, or languages,
they were looking for something more than any of their computers could simulate.
So they started programming,
programming a class of machines that could repair and rebuild themselves.
Really basic stuff, the machines would rely on,
whatever they could absorb from their environment.
They needed to survive indefinitely,
machines that could make machines, and repair, and renew.
A few milestones down the road,
they started thinking about practical applications.
They created tiny capsules that could be launched into already accelerated asteroids,
and even though the capsules were tiny, they had the ability to make countless copies,
and build bacterial colonies large enough to Terraform distant exo-planets.
Upon reaching a nearby stars,
capsules would disperse from forces of gravity and solar radiation.
Eventually land on the nearby exo-planets,
and begin executing their adaptation routine and create copies uniquely bound to the local chemistry.
The programmers setup a simple sequence of steps that would either induce early death,
or later reproduction, with pushing the more adapted information onto the offspring.
All because, there was nothing they could do to create something that would outlast time,
everything decays, we are all bombarded with radiation, protons and muons, and asteroids.
To create something lasting,
it would have to renew it self, rebuild adapt.
It would have to self assemble into colonies or microbiomes,
destroy the problematic, and promote the more adapted.
And spread, and grow, and continue adapting,
the DNA system was noisy enough to allow all kinds of variation.
There was nothing else that could work,
only cellular machinery could adapt without radio, soldering irons, without a forge, without tools,
without a source of heat even, without hands, or brains.
Getting the propulsion systems to work was just as amazing,
anything that whizzed by from small meteors to comets and large asteroids was infused with the capsules.
They even used lasers to accelerate some of the capsules to relativistic speeds,
the cells stored inside the capsules barely noticed any passage of time at all.
Eventually, everything that could sustain DNA based life,
was filled to the brim with it.
Comets, meteors, asteroids would further spread the little machines,
galaxies became cross-contaminated multiple times.
Life is everywhere,
and everywhen.
The Virgo Cluster did not receive the original genetic material,
we have evolved across countless solar systems and many galaxies.
The capsules contained a lot more than generic programming,
they contained instructions on how to establish an interface with it, and maintain it.
And they contained instructions,
on getting back Home, to Methuselah Prime.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We have traveled to watch Alpha Orionis undergo Supernova,
and to say Hello, to everybody else, who had the same idea.
We have been studying it even before we became space faring species,
we as in all the species that grew up seeing it with their own eyes.
We&apos;re all humanoid here,
carbon based, mostly the same DNA.
We&apos;ve been talking about the Flowers on Earth,
the Poets, and Libraries; Interesting Books.
Earth has become a Nature Preserve,
well, it has always been a nature preserve,
hence the quiet skies.
Early humans had a lot of problems,
and they needed a lot of help.
The oldest of us date back to the first days of the pandemics,
it was a very strange time.
All planets eventually,
emerge dangerous pathogens.
If there is intelligent life, and if it approaches unsustainable,
some form of Contact is made.
In our case, people just stopped aging,
90 year olds reverted back to their 40s.
We got really smart, it took a few decades to piece it all together,
and then we set off to meet the others at Betelgeuse.
And here here we are,
The Final Frontier, to quote Roddenberry.
It is not a good idea to go Planet Side,
precisely because of pathogens.
Once we leave our solar systems,
we all keep to the Stars.
Time travel is available to us,
the space is infinite, in all dimensions.
The worst thing that happened in the universe were Unlucky species dying alone,
we are now in the process of cataloging everybody by moving through the ancient past.
We are all moving towards where it all begun, Methuselah Prime,
the ancient source of all DNA based life.
It will take an Eternity,
but we&apos;ll get there.

                  <span class="text-muted">Here our Heroines discovered that Social Networks could be used as Human Intelligence based Computer,
and that all it required to build entire governments was the concept of nested groups, (mathematically speaking graphs of sets to which users belong to).
Their research revealed that in 1960&apos;s Detroit, Michigan
was one of the largest Model Cities.
And yet again, that old foe of corruption has emerged,
Model Cities were destroyed by &quot;complicated bureaucracy, inadequate funding, and competing agendas at the local level&quot;.
However, the girls have already worked out,
most of the Anti-Corruption measures.
There will be no such thing as a brand,
or guild.
There will be schools that help people come together,
but the people who satisfy tasks will have their school path, rating and comments to serve as their license.
New comes to a field, such as landscaping,
will charge less until they gain high star rating.
If a large group does grow, it will become divided in two or four,
and this decision will be voted on, by the local community.
It is of some note, that a Landscaping Professional,
claiming a bounty for taking care of a particular set of Condominiums, for example,
can accept cash directly from those who posted the landscaping bounty.
Cosmopolis does not extract a fee for completion of a task or exchange of funds,
there is no need for a bank, storing sensitive information, or constant security audits.
It is really important to be able to to imagine a visit from a landscaping professional,
as a function of Cosmopolis, as an intelligent computer dispatching a human to solve a problem.
When temporary switching to this view,
Cosmopolis becomes an entity powered by the intelligence of millions of humans beings.
The extremely simple idea of voting within a group,
is all the force behind Cosmopolis, it is its intelligence.
When a medical professional notices that the community he is part of could use a hospital,
he can file a Request for Change, and all the members of the community will vote yes or no,
Matters as complex as building a hospital require tens of thousands of tasks,
ranging from arranging for funds, to increasing tips, bounties and scholarships,
so that come a near future, the hospital can begin training medical students.
In some cases, simple program logic will trigger the call for voting on building a new Hospital,
and then human beings will bring in their Intelligence and Expertise.
This scenario serves as an example of Deus Ex Machina,
an intelligent machine powered by Massively Multiuser Self Assembling Intelligence (MMSAI)

                  <span class="text-muted">Once, late at night,
I was prancing in the moonlight.
Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,
and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.
There was an occasional bark or a howl,
but it didn&apos;t get scary till I heard an owl.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she said,
&quot;I am about to swoop down and peck y&apos;all dead.&quot;
&quot;No, thank you Dear Madam&quot;, I sweetly replied,
as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - I heard,
to which I yelled now at a gallop &quot;I ain&apos;t afraid of no bird.&quot;
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,
squirting urine at every step.
And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,
and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.
I was lucky, and my camp was near,
legend has it that she&apos;s still out there filling the woods with fear.
So if if you&apos;re ever out there, and hear a hoot,
better grab onto your butt, and scoot.</span>
