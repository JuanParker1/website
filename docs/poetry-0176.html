          <p>You can&apos;t leap into whatever you conceive Enlightenment to be,<br>
            it is built layer by layer, step by step, and year by year.</p>
          <p>We all need might, never has a creature been alive that didn&apos;t need strength,<br>
            and waiting until the last moment; is a bad idea, anyway.</p>
          <p>That&apos;s why people run marathons,<br>
            this is why people challenge themselves with practice.</p>
          <p>So that when life becomes a challenge,<br>
            for all the finish lines they crossed, failure won&apos;t cross their mind.</p><br>
          <p>A self challenge, is a practice of strength,<br>
            it is good for us.</p>
          <p>It is different challenges for different people,<br>
            at different places in their lives.</p>
          <p>But there is one thing they all have in common,<br>
            whatever they set off to do, it seems impossible at first.</p>
          <p>That&apos;s what the hard parts of life are like,<br>
            they seem like an impassible challenge at first.</p><br>
          <p>Practice makes us strong,<br>
            difficult challenges help us grow, and help us think too.</p>
          <p>It is all for life,<br>
            it is all for enlightenment.</p>
          <p>It is all for living above the common levels of life,<br>
            it is all for knowing that no matter the challenge, we will find a way.</p>
          <p>May we all grow wise, and strong, and healthy,<br>
            may we each find a mountain to move and inspire a generation.</p>
