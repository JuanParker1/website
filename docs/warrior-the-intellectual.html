                    <p>To those of you who retain some remnant of dignity and the will to live
                      your lives for yourselves, you have the chance to make the same choice.
                      Examine your values and understand that you must choose one side or the
                      other. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps
                      the evil.</p>
                    <p>If you&apos;ve understood what I&apos;ve said, stop supporting your destroyers.</p>
                    <p>Don&apos;t accept their philosophy.</p>
                    <p>Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your
                      innocence, and your love.</p>
                    <p>Don&apos;t exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you see around
                      you now.</p>
                    <p>In the name of the best within you, don&apos;t sacrifice the world to those who
                      will take away your happiness for it.</p>

                    <p>Go placidly amid the noise and haste,</p>
                    <p>and remember what peace there may be in silence.</p>
                    <p>As far as possible without surrender</p>
                    <p>be on good terms with all persons.</p>
                    <p>Speak your truth quietly and clearly;</p>
                    <p>and listen to others,</p>
                    <p>even the dull and the ignorant;</p>
                    <p>they too have their story.</p>
                    <p>Avoid loud and aggressive persons,</p>
                    <p>they are vexations to the spirit.</p>
                    <p>If you compare yourself with others,</p>
                    <p>you may become vain and bitter;</p>
                    <p>for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</p>
                    <p>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</p>
                    <p>Keep interested in your own career, however humble;</p>
                    <p>it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</p>
                    <p>Exercise caution in your business affairs;</p>
                    <p>for the world is full of trickery.</p>
                    <p>But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;</p>
                    <p>many persons strive for high ideals;</p>
                    <p>and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>
                    <p>Be yourself.</p>
                    <p>Especially, do not feign affection.</p>
                    <p>Neither be cynical about love;</p>
                    <p>for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment</p>
                    <p>it is as perennial as the grass.</p>
                    <p>Take kindly the counsel of the years,</p>
                    <p>gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</p>
                    <p>Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.</p>
                    <p>But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</p>
                    <p>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</p>
                    <p>Beyond a wholesome discipline,</p>
                    <p>be gentle with yourself.</p>
                    <p>You are a child of the universe,</p>
                    <p>no less than the trees and the stars;</p>
                    <p>you have a right to be here.</p>
                    <p>And whether or not it is clear to you,</p>
                    <p>no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</p>
                    <p>Therefore be at peace with God,</p>
                    <p>whatever you conceive Him to be,</p>
                    <p>and whatever your labors and aspirations,</p>
                    <p>in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.</p>
                    <p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,</p>
                    <p>it is still a beautiful world.</p>
                    <p>Be cheerful.</p>
                    <p>Strive to be happy.</p>

                      for this talk he would have wanted to come up with a powerful message, an
                      idea worth sharing. While extraordinary claims, require extraordinary
                      evidence; a simple question begs a simple answer.</p>
                    <p>Yes. Schools kill creativity.</p>

Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
