                  <span class="text-muted">Of course, it is not just aging,
but is it also more than just learning.
Some say &quot;Lean into the discomfort.&quot;,
others &quot;Don&apos;t try go all the way.&quot;.
It is all about building ourselves,
layer by layer.
The layers,
need not always be on the same subject.
You may start an artist, or a dreamer, or a mechanic,
and then move to urban explorer, photographer, and islander.
The steps we take are slightly different,
from what we take away.
An artist learns the harmony of colors,
the strange simplicity of desaturating colors by mixing opposites.
The dreamer learns that a dream is not just a dream,
because if you snag on it and carry it out, it will become true.
The mechanic learns about a screw,
if you tighten it too much you will ruin it.
The urban explorer learns that the attorney,
that left his stuff behind was always suffering and died alone.
The photographer learns that it is the journey,
and the photo is a mere bookmark in memories.
And the islander,
ohh, the islander.
Finally, when the golden age of wisdom and endless aches and grunts comes,
the islander learns that life is to be lived fully.
And what that means, is that we take what we learned from the day before,
mix it with today, and get it ready to mix it with tomorrow.
Like a waterfall that runs into to the ocean,
the new things we learn add to the body of the old.
With old age being a privilege denied to so many,
the treasure we carry truly becomes magnificent as we move forth.
We can&apos;t learn all at once,
and we can&apos;t fully learn through synthetic means.
At schools the curriculum is so warped,
it can only be dishonestly memorized.
Audio Books and Lectures, go a long way,
so as long as you make room for the lessons within.
Education requires room, here there can be no stress from grades,
no craziness for a high GPA, brand name education, and a promise of a job.
We need life, we need the full thickness of life,
and then an urge to study will emerge.
That thick life,
will move us.
It will uncover an absence of knowledge,
and it will feel great to fill it right up with precisely 14 books on the subject.
A synthetic education born from being forced to learn,
is a very poor education.
Memorization,
is not an education at all, it is actually dangerous and stupid.
And networking with grads from a brand name university to get stuff done,
has nothing to do with getting educated, it is a service trading club.
Learning from books,
whilst walking a huge trail filled with Bobcats and Mountain Lions,
is far superior of a teacher than anything claiming to educate today.
And one of the best things about books,
is that they make mistakes sometimes.
Their authors get so inspired,
that their ideas sometimes take off and fly in the sky.
And when you catch a famous Author on such a flight of fancy,
you learn even more, you learn about Excellence.
(And how useless, and desperate, and child like book critics are.)
Medical Schools are not an exception here,
textbooks are important, practice even more,
but so is healing a person on the inside, within their mind.
We can all imagine an excellent doctor, extremely professional,
perfect grades, well read, awesome person all around, no complaints.
And we can imagine what it is like to suffer without hope,
and seeing this kind individual, just move on to the next patient.
See, being a perfect Doctor, is not enough,
the surgery is not over when the procedure is done.
And people can tell when someone merely follows etiquette,
and merely pops in for a moment to say something nice, and be done with it.
Be it a Doctor, Scientist, Musician, Artist,
Dreamer, Adventurer, Rebel, even Beloved Professor...
...more is needed.
Greatness of heart,
is a really good start.
But, I think the golden standard of Life and Art,
is; Vastness of Heart.
There is no describing it, but these Beautiful Beings,
smile, and laugh, no matter the weather,
And when they speak, they seem to be part of Cosmos,
not just Earth.
A Mechanic who borrows from his work,
for purposes of Wisdom.
Will hold up a screw,
and say.
&quot;In order for this important piece of the system to do its job,
you have to know when too much of tightening the screw will damage it.&quot;
This is a good example of what we see in schools,
Elementary is a Dream, Middle School kind of works,
but creating High School by just making subjects more demanding, is insane.
The screw is tightened,
damaged, and now, it cannot be repaired.
At the very least, we must help the children to create a start-up,
to work together on building 3D printed inventions, learning Linux, and coming up with new stuff.
And help them setup a way of charging customers,
a way of advertising products, and wipe their fears of poverty.
The kids, are always smarter than us,
they build on top of what we have built.
We are not giving them the tools for their future,
we teach pure Trigonometry and this cannot be dumber.
Because to teach Trigonometry,
all the teacher has to do is create a class about
building games that get published on Steam (game store).
What a teacher may not do,
is force feed pure triangle garbage to people who don&apos;t have an interest in it.
It is not hormones (and no teacher should ever say that), students simply stop listing,
when they figure out the teachers are... selling them out for a paycheck.
Dreamers are my favorite,
here is someone who sits down and thinks up the following,
&quot;If I was born on a different continent,
to a different religion, I would be asked to worship that other god that I am told is false.&quot;
&quot;Furthermore,&quot; - and you know there is always a furthermore,
that&apos;s part of the reason why they cannot be stopped.
&quot;Aren&apos;t we all atheists,
to all the other gods.&quot;
And just when you think she was done with it,
she adds &quot;Why don&apos;t we go the extra step and love All Life, All Wisdom, All Good Ideas, and All Human Beings&quot;
And the next thing you know,
you realize she was never a Dreamer, nor was she ever little.
She&apos;s a Philosopher.
To tell children, that there exists a group of Universal Beings,
that dedicate their lives and immortality to Wisdom,
and passing it on to all the future generations,
is to help them grow from the highest of mountains.
And the Urban Explorer,
they see homes after the families left.
They see pictures,
and smiles, and forgotten hopes.
They see passage of time,
they see the motion of generation upon generation.
They can see the homes as they were on Christmas,
and they can read the medical bills scattered in the corner.
These so called scoundrels,
often chased away like dogs.
They are working on wording a lesson,
that they hope to voice some day.
Maybe come their golden age,
as Guggenheim shows their works.
They will speak of leaving bad ideas behind,
and sharing in all the good ones.
How truly precious all our daily chores,
how it is these little ordinary moments that add to create almost all our lives.
&quot;There are no ordinary moments&quot; as Dan Millman says.
Layer by layer, and the sequence will come deep from within the heart,
and it will reveal it self by means of curiosity.
When a day comes, and you find yourself looking out the window,
with more pleasure than than writing games or interactive fiction,
or managing your corporation, or putting out fire tornadoes.
Deep from within your heart,
a new curiosity calls to you.
And it can only make you better,
better at what you do, help you climb higher than the height you are on right now.
You don&apos;t have to switch careers,
but you do need to throw a loaf of bread into your back pack.
And hit the trail.
If you are out east Section Hike the Appalachian Trail,
if you are out west than hike the Pacific Crest Trail,
if you are out in the Pacific then set of for the Kalalau on the island of Ka&apos;uai.
Bring your Audio Books,
and make no mistake,
Because the end of that trail,
marks only the beginning of your new adventure.
Remember the aim, my friends:
Vastness Of Heart!</span>

there is something you should know.
Put on your mittens, and a hat,
and buy a big bottle of suntan lotion right where you&apos;re at.
But don&apos;t drive back home, just turn south on 275,
and drive.
We&apos;re going all the way down,
to take care of your frown.
You&apos;ll drive through Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
right till you get to good old Georgia.
Here you stop, and get some sleep.
but wake up early, cause we got a pace to keep.
Drive all the way through Florida to US Highway One,
and be ready to catch some sun.
Get to Little Duck Key,
and park beneath a palm tree.
Now, squirt some suntan lotion.
and enjoy the Ocean.

                  <span class="text-muted">Our cognitive biases,
will only keep causing trouble for as long as we are unaware of them.
Eventually, new, fully functional educational systems,
will help us to Knowledge and Wisdom.
As we learn to trust computers,
we will learn to stop relying on easily corruptible career politicians.
The educated voter democracies of the future,
will stand as powerful machines helping us manage our cities and Earth with the wisdom of the crowds.
The world before us lost 99% of its species,
the climate is ever changing.
The layer of oxygen we all rely on is extraordinary thin,
and most of earth is Ocean and the rest requires that we protect ourselves from elements.
While we are bound to this planet chemically,
Earth never really relied on us for anything.
We are not the destroyers, not is Earth,
we are simply yet to be fully awakened caretakers and maintainers.
We need a more powerful educational system,
one that reaches deep into all corners of Humanity,
From Yawanawa, Romani, Maasai, Samoyeds, Rotumans, and Hawaiians,
we all have to come together now as a single family.
What must connect us, is education,
which is just a path to Knowledge and Wisdom.
Whoever we are, and whatever we think we are doing,
we are made much better by inheritance of Knowledge and Wisdom,
which in turn begets Compassion, and Empathy, and the very cure for our Cognitive Biases.
The Love of The Human Family,
and the Insight and Understanding it entails.
It is OK to have made mistakes,
it is just our cognitive biases,
and lack of education, and poverty, and fear.
But it is not OK to stay within the confines of those mistakes,
Earth needs our help, the animals need our help too,
and we can&apos;t help them without Education and the Unity it entails.
All it will take is Storytellers and Lovers of Science and Knowledge,
and Narrators, reading it all in the many languages.
May this century,
become The Century Of The School.
A tiny Audio Player, perhaps a solar powered School on a Chip,
or free access satellites that truly bring the internet to all.
We don&apos;t have to Love All Humanity at first,
just the Tigers, the Big Pussy Cats, 3,890 left,
let us come together now, let us help Earth and all of her inhabitants.
And where education leads,
the nations will follow.

A vocabulary, is also an aid for thinking,

And the edge is a sacred place,

And, it becomes your anchor,
the thing that makes sense.
it becomes the point from which you measure other things,
as you progress forward.
And, Look who else is here,
the Elder You.
They all come here, at every plateau, in each great loneliness,
ask them what their regrets are, and prevent them all from occurring.
The edge is a sacred place,

                  <span class="text-muted">It is not &quot;the secret to happiness&quot;,
it is that happiness; is the secret.
Happiness is the true human superpower.
Sure, we can push through anything,
and adapt to everything.
But, in happiness,
our might multiples to no end.
And happiness can&apos;t be faked,
happiness depends on authenticity.
I think it is the key to learning,
adventuring, exploring, and discovering.
It is the key to invention, to creativity,
to becoming a force of nature.
Happiness puts us up,
on the highest of levels of existence.
Right up there with distant supernoveae,
quasars, neutron stars, and stellar nurseries.
On par with the Universe,
contributing something the quarks and quasars can&apos;t.
I am certain, we only have one flaw,
just a small stupid mistake
One that that can be easily avoided,
so as long as we remind each other about it.
We accept what we are born into as a standard,
and along with it we accepts the false leaders as well.
If the culture and its leaders are headed for a black hole,
we have an overwhelming tendency to blindly follow.
We have to grab each other, with Art, Music, Poetry,
with Doodles and Graffiti, Hugging, Shouting, and Howling.
Grab each other by the ears and whisper,
whilst gently rocking the head in every direction.
&quot;Do not go gentle into that good night,
rage, rage, against the dying of light.&quot;
And when we snap out of that gravitational pull,
we must begin our journey up, all the way up.
Nobody knows,
what comes first.
Healing, Leadership.
Love of Live, Joy of Being,
Love, Happiness, Wisdom,
Greatness, Enlightenment.
Authenticity, Dignity, Nobility,
Courage, Valor, Honor, Heroism.
Adventure, Content of Character, Strength and Unbreakability,
Fortitude, Foresight, Understanding, Insight.
Creativity, Invention,
Dance and Rebellion.
I suppose no one knows which comes first because it all comes at once,
all of those marvels are one, indivisible, part of Being Human.
We must avoid what Dear Sir Ken Robinson refereed to as,
Taking Things for Granted.
We must avoid assuming that something is true,
without thinking about it, without questioning it.
We must resist self-indoctrination into cultures,
that we are merely born into.
Only when we break away from that dark thoughtless path,
will we be able to freely grow and rise up.
Only on our way up,
will we find Happiness, and the other Marvels.
And although this century will be a challenging one,
when we face it upright.
Enabled by the marvels that makes us Human, and on par with the universe,
we will rise, and learn, and become wiser for it.
We have lost ten tigers, in recent weeks,
we are down to 3890 tigers.
The Tragedy of the Big Pussy Cats,
is one way, that the universe is helping us rise.
Remember, first you must learn to resist indoctrination,
resist taking things for granted, resist following leaders you don&apos;t know,
resist the fallacy of choosing the lesser evil.
And second, you must take to books,
self educate by falling in love with Humanity&apos;s most celebrated works.
With each step upwards towards becoming a great being,
you will gain more and more abilities.
And third, Educated Humanity,
is a United Humanity.
To repeat one of the quotes by Robert Ardrey that Sir Ken Robinson was fond of,
&quot;...We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels,
The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk
but how magnificently he has risen.
We are known among the stars by our poems...&quot;</span>
