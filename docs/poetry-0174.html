          <p>The only thing keeping us back, is lack of wisdom,<br>
            this is occurring because the world places no emphasis on becoming wise.</p>
          <p>Without wisdom we can&apos;t even tell if education is real or not,<br>
            ...the mark of a real education are real results.</p>
          <p>Without wisdom we can&apos;t tell what real results even are,<br>
            without wisdom we begin repeating old mistakes.</p>
          <p>People say fake news - nope,<br>
            but it is actually the fake education...</p><br>
          <p>Real education, helps a person become Wise and Noble,<br>
            Triumphant, Successful, Strong, Unbreakable.</p>
          <p>In the real world no one ever celebrates graduation,<br>
            because Real Education is about a Dignified, Realistic Success.</p>
          <p>If all students get is a Diploma and a Laboratory,<br>
            or even Debt and a job they didn&apos;t need a University for.</p><br>
          <p>It is just a waste of time,<br>
            and time is priceless.</p><br>
          <p>The central component of Real Education is Joy,<br>
            and satisfaction, and a sense of progression, and the undoing of the threat of poverty.</p>
          <p>But without wisdom, it is hard to define poverty,<br>
            or satisfaction, or even what joy is supposed to mean in context of education.</p>
          <p>Without wisdom, we are easily tricked that memorization has something to do with education,<br>
            we are easily tricked that confusion is just us not being good enough.</p><br>
          <p>Memorization, is a cheap trick used by worthless teachers,<br>
            to pretend that they are doing something.</p>
          <p>And by memorizing you make them appear legitimate,<br>
            you make them produce grades, and appear as teachers.</p>
          <p>And that confusion is there because their lectures make no sense,<br>
            the text books probably don&apos;t make much sense either.</p><br>
          <p>There is no conspiracy,<br>
            it is just people trying to fake it until they make it.</p>
          <p>Many do have lessons they could teach you,<br>
            and just as many will keep them to themselves.</p>
          <p>Just to appear smarter someday, or just out of spite,<br>
            &quot;Why should I tell them, it is not in the text book&quot;.</p><br>
          <p>Lack of wisdom will keep a teacher, childlike,<br>
            keep them thinking &quot;this is just a job&quot;, &quot;it is us versus them&quot;,<br>
            and that usual &quot;I hate them&quot;, or &quot;hate my job&quot;.</p>
          <p>There are good teachers out there,<br>
            but for all their goodness,<br>
            they know deep down in their hearts.</p>
          <p>That it is easier for you to learn on your own adventures,<br>
            Then for them to try to help you understand what they know.</p><br>
          <p>Learning is very intimate, and teaching what one knows is taking that intimacy,<br>
            and trying to reshape it for strangers.</p>
          <p>Almost by definition this takes away all the passion,<br>
            all the value of the lessons.</p><br>
          <p>Good Teacher,<br>
            may just be an Oxymoron.</p>
          <p>It is your life, it must be your own path of discovery and self betterment,<br>
            no one can help you through this.</p>
          <p>Learning languages, is something we do naturally,<br>
            not by memorizing but by becoming submerged in the language; by actually needing it for survival.</p>
          <p>If you want to learn French,<br>
            head for the Colonies, inhale the language, don&apos;t memorize it.</p>
          <p>Learning mathematics, is similar, you don&apos;t do it by memorization,<br>
            in Real Mathematics same symbols mean different things based on context and author.</p>
          <p>To learn Math, you start in the beginning,<br>
            and slowly trace its development across Empires and centuries.</p>
          <p>Whatever it is You Have To Love It,<br>
            can you imagine loving every mathematician?</p>
          <p>Because that&apos;s what it takes to learn Math for real,<br>
            or Physics, or Chemistry, or Biology, or Astrophysics.</p>
          <p>Now imagine trying to teach a stranger,<br>
            what you have learned, but without the love that you have personally felt for it.</p>
          <p>Oxymoron.</p><br>
          <p>Being good at Biology, Dancing, Medicine, Trail Running, Math, Electronics, Art, Computers, Music,<br>
            still means little.</p>
          <p>We get good at things we like,<br>
            it is not a big deal to be good at something.</p><br>
          <p>Being Wise, is a Big Deal,<br>
            being able to Authentically and Nobly navigate live in a Dignified Fashion.</p>
          <p>With wisdom, we can figure out how the world works,<br>
            the World is not a Mechanical Machine, now will it ever become a Political One,<br>
            it is a Conundrum of Human Conditions.</p>
          <p>All else must yield,<br>
            it must.</p>
          <p>It must,<br>
            until you are touching the fabric of the future with your very own fingertips.</p>
          <p>Until,<br>
            you feel like a hero.</p>
          <p>Until it is your voice, and your soul, and heart, and your works,<br>
            and your strength.</p>
          <p>That make him, rise,<br>
            with certainty of knowing, you are correct.</p>
          <p>Tired old man,<br>
            who has seen everything and heard every lie.</p>
          <p>He&apos;s been a District Judge for more than he can remember,<br>
            but he has heard every world yo said.</p>
          <p>And the moment you mentioned,<br>
            that it is Human Rights Day, he groaned.</p>
          <p>And he stood downstairs,<br>
            keeping his hands warm with a cup of coffee.</p>
          <p>And he stood there much longer than you could,<br>
            and it marked the end of his career.</p>
          <p>But he never forgot your words,<br>
            because your words were filled with wisdom.</p>
          <p>Because you searched for it,<br>
            because you fought for it.</p>
          <p>Because you were courageous,<br>
            it all became crystal clear in your mind.</p>
          <p>And more than moving a single judge,<br>
            you will grow to move a generation.</p>
          <p>Grow to renew the search for meaning,<br>
            the Love of Wisdom.</p>
          <p>You moved mountains,<br>
            you gave speeches long past your retirement.</p>
          <p>As the cities of the future grew,<br>
            and as you grew.</p>
          <p>And the life of wisdom made it so,<br>
            that your name and the symbols it stood for earned permanence in Human History.</p><br>
          <p>Wisdom, is your right,<br>
            it is your first fight,<br>
            it is your greatest might.<br></p>
          <p>Rise my friend,<br>
            rise to no end,<br>
            the world needs you to set the trend.</p>
