        <p>We have an aversion to being trapped,<br>
          because of an innate sense of distance that we must travel.</p>
        <p>The distance begins the moment we gain self-awareness,<br>
          the end, does not matter - only the distance does.</p><br>
        <p>You are in charge of the direction of your journey,<br>
          if you let it lead you, it will pull you in all directions.</p>
        <p>In letting the life dictate,<br>
          you will become divided.</p><br>
        <p>In doing the dictating,<br>
          you, will set the aim.</p>
        <p>If you let yourself become a leader,<br>
          you will arrive at a singe destination.</p><br>
        <p>In one way, or another,<br>
          you will, without a doubt, arrive.</p>
        <p>The Universe, cannot stop what you start,<br>
          the Universe will gently let your existence expand.</p><br>
        <p>It is tough to be led and expect clarity,<br>
          there will be too much noise from following.</p>
        <p>But in leading, there is no noise,<br>
          the path is pure, as pure as your imagination.</p><br>
        <p>The steps along your journey,<br>
          extract a price.</p>
        <p>The Universe smiles,<br>
          as you pay your way.</p><br>
        <p>You start as a child,<br>
          and the first step is very difficult.</p>
        <p>And the second, and fourth grade,<br>
          and sixth semester, and eighth book.</p><br>
        <p>Your singular ripple,<br>
          unlike everything else out in the Universe;</p>
        <p>Has a breathtaking order dictated from within,<br>
          not pushed by the chaos, but dictated by your mind.</p><br>
        <p>Can you imagine how boring chaos becomes,<br>
          and can you see how beautiful your perfect ripple.</p>
        <p>The edge of chaos that surrounds your beauty,<br>
          is pushed out by a kind, of Youniverse.</p><br>
        <p>Let me be clear,<br>
          you are not a river, nor a snowball, or a butterfly&apos;s wing.</p>
        <p>There is enough of those, already,<br>
          nothing worthy of you, needs you to follow.</p><br>
        <p>It is a Law of The Universe,<br>
          that no Human should follow.</p>
        <p>A river should flows surely to the sea,<br>
          but a Human, is meant to Lead.</p><br>
        <p>It is a simple but forgotten lesson,<br>
          it is meant to sit next to; Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>That no human should serve nor follow,<br>
          non should practice resignation.</p><br>
        <p>If you feel weak,<br>
          it is because you resigned for too long.</p>
        <p>And you will have to start in the beginning,<br>
          and your first step will be very difficult.</p>
