                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision.

                  <span class="text-muted">Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett: English political leader, activist, writer and feminist icon. Known as a campaigner for women&apos;s suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until 1919 she led Britain&apos;s largest women&apos;s rights organisation, the National Union of Women&apos;s Suffrage Societies. The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.: Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop, and often block traffic. If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want to do their job, go home, and get paid. If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job and go watch some TV. You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&apos;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot; and you&apos;ll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you&apos;ll struggle to remember where it all started and what the battle was for. Because The Battle Is Not For You: The battle is for those that come; after you. In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the same. In long term, you help the world grow, it won&apos;t be your world, it will be the world of the future. The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education are two separate things. It will make you tired. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood. Bad News: There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too low. Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education, the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot; grades, making your parents happy. Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never looking back. Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue. Henry David Thoreau: I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms... The Good News: Real Education, is not about getting really educated. It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health. Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is not a healthy life. Faith of the Heart Article One: Inherent Dignity, Nobility.: The first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility. No one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or vacation, or else. You are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you are to rage, to rage against the dying of the light.

                  <span class="text-muted">You are a Genius.: Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks. One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: The English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication. The &quot;Double U&quot;, the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde? Rhymes. Poems. Songs. Letters. Essays. Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades, parents? Memorizing Poems? Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did. Speaking. Reading. Writing. Thorgal: undefined Frameworks are superpowers, and your powers will call to you.: Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like Storytelling, for example. You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings, now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, and Faster Than Light Travel. You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on a message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will mark forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it alive across centuries even as English evolves. Story of Beowulf Land of Monsters?: My friends, the story of Grendles M&#x14D;dor remains unfinished, Ides Agl&#xE6;cwif of &#xC6;lwihta Eard; beacons her side to be writ. Was Grendles Modor a monster, would she be an Ide then? Was the Dragon a mere reminder, a clumsy blurb for Memento Mori or is that just the introduction to the real story, the story that has little to do with men like Beowulf who can&apos;t even take down a fat flying lizard right. A story burned to the ground by the spirit of the age, the Greatest Story Never Told, The Story of The Ides of the Old World. Pick up the pen. Rebuild the story a thousand times, and let the version 1001 earn you a place in history. The Dises (1909) by Dorothy Hardy.: undefined A Pen is Mightier than a Sword.: Genius, is to answer the challenge. &#xC6;lwihta Eard, is the world of our childhood stories, from Baba Jaga, to The One Ring, to Harry Potter, and beyond. Genius is to pick up the pen, and not fear sounding foolish. Do not deny your Readers: Do not deny your stories to those who are still learning the lessons you have already mastered. What if your &quot;Not good enough&quot;, will become the best they ever had? Mightier than The Sword. Damn kids. They&apos;re all alike.: When I was learning English, my most powerful piece of literature was The Conscience of a Hacker, or The Hacker Manifesto. (See External Links section for Hacker&apos;s Manifesto at Phrack Magazine) I am wiser now, the text is for a teenager. But I feel no shame for still holding it dear to my heart. I am glad to share with you. The Conscience of a Hacker by undefined: ... We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it&apos;s for our own good, yet we&apos;re the criminals. Damn kids. They&apos;re all alike.: These words are still as mighty as the day I found them. The Conscience of a Hacker read by The Mentor You are a Genius.: Because storytelling, inspiration, sharing of wisdom, is just a part of The English Framework for Human Communication - that you mastered without noticing... as a child. At the age of 15 or earlier, you master a framework almost as complex as any of the more interesting Daughters of Philosophy (The Sciences). It comes to you so naturally, that you don&apos;t notice it. You think we are born with the ability for language. But, no. And not only do you learn it, your brain grows to match the complexity of information and tools needed to manipulate it. Neuro Genesis: You can grow new brain cells. Here&apos;s how by Sandrine Thuret Genius, like Child Prodigy, is just a stepping stone. Don&apos;t stop.: You are to surpass what you think Genius is, on your way up, to growing all the way up. This act of transcendence will recur several times, depending how busy you get in life. Some things you think are one-way today; High School, Roswell, Globalization, Content of Character, Memorable Words, Superstars, Mokele-Mbembe, Spelling and Grammar (To use my teenage mind as example) will change meaning, as you grow; possibly/hopefully even reverse. Similar to how &quot;We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn&apos;t run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.&quot; turns around, as we learn that Criminal Phreaking is just not worth the damn prison time. My Dear, Friends, Readers. You have mastered English. You have easily mastered something only a genius child prodigy could. Didn&apos;t even notice it, English came so naturally, so simply - didn&apos;t it? ... and you say you are not a Genius? Wow, just wow. English is Complex: Let me give you a hint on you how Frameworks like these emerge evolve across centuries. A History of English Letters Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding: Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means progressive, gradual learning and mastery. It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here &quot;The English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication&quot; bonds really well with our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it would still be a functional, but very different language. Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn something, it won&apos;t be learned. But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously had trouble with it. For example in God Created the Integers: The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History Stephen Hawking helped his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I view the book as a Memory Palace with emphasis on historical dates and progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics. What if Schools Taught Us How to Learn by Jonathan Levi Memorizing &#x3C0;r&#xB2;: Do you remember memorizing &#x3C0;r&#xB2;? Forcing memorization of &#x3C0;r&#xB2; or any formula, should be seen as psychological torture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspension of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made. Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English without the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel. Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can&apos;t comprehend &#x3C0;r&#xB2;, and her mind rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there a geometric square somehow? Warm, but not warm enough. A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forced to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year. People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not to, learn Mathematics, or be punished. Area of a circle, how to get the formula. Just Eyeball: Just witness that half the circumference of the circle (4 slices) are used at the the base of the rectangle, because the other four are used up top. It really does not matter how many divisions of the circle so as long as reaching infinity makes for an infinitely perfect rectangle &#x2764; The Framework is Mightier Than The Formula: Armed with this knowledge, our young lady, can arrive at her own &#x3C0;r&#xB2;, when needed. But also at E=mc&#xB2;, and all the wonderful rest. And so can you. My Genius Reader. Genius Is Our Right: Genius is knowing the framework mechanics, and reinventing the formulas as needed. Sometimes, applying mechanics from one place by subtle analogy to another. For example apply lessons from trains and their relativity of motion and distortion of sound waves, to other things... Simple Relativity - Understanding Einstein&apos;s Special Theory of Relativity Einstein&apos;s Proof of E=mc2 Math: Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of programming. Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in mathematics. Math as Code It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As Math as Code notes &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).&quot; It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop. Let us face that today&apos;s &quot;Alphabet of Math&quot; is basic Programming. This is because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn out to be to you now. As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like P5js or maybe D3, or even SVG (keep it in sync with leading Web Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming, exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment opportunities). Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games, visualizations. Karlie Kloss explains how to use math with the artist in Code Studio Easy as &#x3C0;: Look a the ease with which Karlie Kloss teaches real, live, moving, interactive, Modern Math to children. It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like Math as Code children who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and Abstract Mathematics. A child using the program that Karlie teaches with will see little surface difference between making a rectangle and converting matter to energy via Einstein&apos;s E=mc&#xB2;. A venture into the function contents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, may perhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet, both. In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates rectangles with a base twice the height. For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull them into the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology. Kode With Klossy shows what these classes are like. What real education looks like, where teachers strive to be worthy of teaching their students. Frameworks: Why. Genius.: Study your Frameworks. Generations have tried to avoid Genius, and the World is hurting for it. We are bound to this planet, chemically, biologically, even intellectually. We are all connected. There is no moving to Mars. And we were never allowed to let the TV, or the talking-heads, or lairs, do the talking - with each new generation, doubly so. We are all connected. Accept The Responsibility: People laugh off running out of water, but that&apos;s actually terribly simple. It will happen like this: U.S. drinking water widely contaminated with &apos;forever chemicals&apos; But remember, all problems created by Humans, can be solved by Humans too. Those That Can&apos;t Do, Teach. Memorization is Over: Tell your teacher that memorization is over, it is useless to you. Tell your teachers that they are not allowed to stand in your way of real knowledge. They are interrupting your real education by threatening to mark you down for not following their worthless directions which can only lead to memorization, which in turn will soon result in you forgetting what you force-remembered. It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way you did it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken advantage of. The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, school qualifying for more funding. GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people will easily mislead you. One example is Vaccine Hesitancy which a lot of people fall for, but there are more complicated and closer calls like CFCs and Tetraethyl Lead, and now PFAS. You need to be knowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in the world. Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don&apos;t count on the adults, they&apos;re all going to retire of old age soon enough. Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on everything from internal decision making, to external politics of the whole World. The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and you will become the future. Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way. You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books. Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot. Genius by Mark Diaz The Future, The World: You were born a Genius. You are a Genius. It is not even that big of a deal, you are a human with a brain, Genius is what we do. On the other end, people saying they are better than you because they are a Genius, are sick from poverty of mind, they got fractured, stuck. It is sad, let us hope they feel better and catch up, but pass them on as they heal. Keep moving forward, keep learning, the World needs you to grow, to grow all the way up, you, and all your peers, and all generations to come. It is the journey of self education that makes the real difference. Begin your journey under the banner of Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence and Love of Wisdom. The Future, and The World, it will all be Yours. You are far more than Genius. Unbreakable. Unstoppable. Uncontainable. Unpredictable. Uncontrollable. You Are The Future. </span>
