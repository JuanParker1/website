                    </header>
                    <p>We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to
                      betray a student for a paycheck.</p>
                    <p>Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired. Many felt
                      bad about the level of education we were receiving.</p>
                    <p>But, whether they liked it or not, consciously or subconsciously, at the
                      end of the day, it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize
                      for long enough to pass standardized testing, and the administration didn&apos;t
                      have a problem with that.</p>

                    <p>They meant no harm, they did it so that they could get paid, so that the
                      school could get funding, so that everyone would keep their job. But those
                      who didn&apos;t rise against it caused harm. They interfered with our real
                      education, harming creativity, erasing individuality.</p>
                    <p>In K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at home,
                      that bullies were a fact, and life is never fair. They hurt our hearts, and
                      shamed us by saying. &quot;Oh, just grow up, already! Because, you need to
                      improve your grades.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;Today, we&apos;ll get it all working, and today we&apos;ll get paid. Tomorrow,
                      tomorrow, when everything is worked-out and working, we&apos;ll get to the
                      students - one thing at a time.&quot; - They&apos;d say.</p>
                    <p>But we knew that tomorrow never comes, once the new day starts, it is
                      already today. The tomorrow they thought of, was more of a garbage can for
                      nice-to-haves.</p>
                    <p>They were working very hard, and it was all very hard work. But they didn&apos;t
                      have the strength to do both, their job, and make schools work.</p>
                    <p>In effect, everyone forgot about us. They forgot we were the point and the
                      future. Their aim was no longer our education, but merely staying in
                      business by arranging for what in effect became, an impression of one.</p>

                    <p>To accomplish all this, some changes needed to be made, they first
                      convinced themselves that they were doing a great job so as long as they
                      were working hard, and then some things needed to be taken away, and a few
                      needed to be twisted around.</p>
                    <p>We were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard, that
                      the administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely
                      stressful. People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices.</p>
                    <p>To question administration or teachers while they work that hard, makes for
                      a heartless, cruel, shameful petty little student.</p>

                    <p>Void of context, many of the shallow arguments the teachers made could
                      almost stand up to a proper debate.</p>
                    <p>But we remained unconvinced because teaching is not just a job. It is not
                      an ordinary job, and it is not just about knowledge.</p>

                      understands their existing body of knowledge, manner of learning, and finds
                      a way to genuinely communicate with them.</p>

                      <h2>Teaching is Complex and Rewarding</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Teaching should respectfully extend their existing knowledge. The teacher
                      must know if fascination with Dinosaurs will head towards Paleontology,
                      Biology, Ecology, and keep an eye on progression of that path (if said path
                      continues) to see is they have a Cell Bilogist, Astrobiologist,
                      Evolutionary Biologist, or maybe a Writer, in their class.</p>
                    <p>The complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward, how
                      fantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary
                      cross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean
                      towards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career.</p>
                    <p>Now, pushing her away from what moves her, grading her down for it, and
                      forcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass
                      the grade. That is something else... And the answer to how many children
                      were hurt this way, is: <strong>all of them</strong>, in every school, on every
                      continent, in every country, state and district.</p>
                    <p>Schools interrupt education.</p>
                    <p>They destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius. They do
                      it just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it.</p>
                    <p>They destroy The Shy, The Delicate, The Compassionate.</p>
                    <p>They destroy Pacifists, Leaders, Scientists, Inventors, Dreamers, Poets,
                      Artists, Sculptors, Musicians, Adventures, Writers, Makers, Heroes.</p>

                    <p>A picture of a real blackboard in a library taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz-gVKwWNzs">F**k Grades by
                        Denise Dutton</a>.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Dutton does not postulate a 2.* GPA student in her talk.</p>
                    <p>I think the person that wrote this was a young woman. And this might have
                      been her last act of defiance in that school.</p>
                    <p>We lost a wise and delicate being, a leader, a scientist, maybe a writer,
                      to silence, rejection, shunning.</p>
                    <p>That late-night scribble is clear Evidence of Exceptional Ability. This is
                      someone we each admire, someone Beautifully Courageous.</p>
                    <p>But she left, she&apos;s gone. They gave her a 2.0 for Leadership,
                      Unbreakability, Heroism, for spending her last semester reading books she
                      loved, at the school library she loved, right before getting thrown out.</p>

                    <p>School is about safety and security and protection, first.</p>
                    <p>It must be a place where we can safely grow, study both Life, and Wisdom.

                    </header>
                    <p>Alas, teaching whilst failing to educate, is fraud.</p>
                    <p>Parading the coffee lovers, who want to breeze through with a 4.0 GPA, to
                      get the hell out, and move past this damn charade. Parading them as
                      successfully educated students, is fraud.</p>
                    <p>Making the quiet girl cry because she wanted to comprehend and not merely
                      memorize, is evil.</p>
                    <p>Turning face away, when the fat kid is being bullied, beaten, assaulted,
                      threatened, kicked, held down, spat upon, is evil.</p>
                    <p>Sending a kid back home, when you just witnessed his father beating him in
                      the bathroom for the bad grades he ended up with, because he can&apos;t memorize
                      anything when he is under constant threat from everybody, is evil.</p>
                    <p>Failing to authentically educate, and then grading down those who rejected
                      the memorization dog and pony show, is evil.</p>
                    <p>Pretending to teach under the poisonous threat of repeating the grade or
                      year, semester or class, threatening kids to stop learning, and start
                      memorizing, is evil.</p>
                    <p>Sending kids home to angry, often violent parents, because they rejected
                      fake education, fake tests, fantasy GPA, is evil.</p>

                      the tests, and that to pass a test we need to cram harder and take more
                      notes, that grade-point-average is the measure of a human - because that is

                    </header>
                    <p>At first we thought we were the losers. We certainly had the grades to
                      prove it. We formed a club. We sarcastically called it The Breakfast Club
                      after an old movie. We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out.</p>
                    <p>We didn&apos;t expect to be seen as the gifted ones.</p>
                    <p>But we had the gift of courage, the gift of search for a clear road ahead.
                      And that road turned out to be becoming a Businessperson, a Founder, a CEO.
                      It was a path that mixed education with rewards, leading onward to
                      independence and a majestic triumph, albeit through many a failure.</p>
                    <p>In school, we were being forced to memorize Trigonometry, Triceps and
                      Triceratops, when what we really needed was help with finding investors to
                      scale our little Breakfast Club business.</p>

                    <p>The others secretly saw us as courageous, strong and unbreakable, healthy
                      and authentic. But they didn&apos;t really know how to relate to us. We were the
                      same but they were too confused by the noise of homework, quizzes, tests,
                      and grades, chores, parents, circles, and punishment, punishment everywhere.</p>
                    <p>The threat of repeating classes, reliving the same noise, or being held
                      back was exactly like prison. Neurologically, Threat and Punishment
                      interferes with Neurogenesis. For the most Delicate, it wasn&apos;t just
                      difficult to cram and memorize, it might have been neurologically
                      impossible.</p>

                      <h2>People tried to help, but they didn&apos;t know how.</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Someone said that the only reason the teachers seemed to know more than we
                      did, was because they had to regurgitate that same stuff every year to keep
                      their jobs...</p>
                    <p>Each time it came up; there was always someone to say that they wanted to
                      help us, but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and
                      destroy, embrace and extinguish. Get the gifted ones out of the system to
                      make things easier for themselves, to calm the waters - if nothing sticks
                      out, it must be all good.</p>
                    <p>Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to cram
                      before a test, pass it, and forget it. Since tests did not represent
                      student knowledge, grades did not represent the student. Everyone knew
                      this, nobody said anything because once the students realized the school
                      was mostly a charade they just wanted to graduate and move on.</p>
                    <p>Overwhelming majority of Teachers didn&apos;t want to change anything because
                      they didn&apos;t want to make their job any harder, they just want to get paid
                      and go home. Statistically half of them quit anyway.</p>
                    <p>Management was focused on grade points and funding.</p>
                    <p>Everybody else was parading solutions, but there was no time, any extras
                      were aimed at symptoms, extras just added to the weight of existing
                      problems.</p>
                    <p>The root cause was that we were not safe, and we were not learning.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>We accepted the responsibility for our own education.</p>
                    <p>We begun learning on our own, through internet, Audio Books, trial and
                      error.</p>
                    <p>We begun building more and more small companies, and the more we failed the
                      wiser we became.</p>
                    <p>The moment schools begun interfering with our companies, with making money
                      that we used to support ourselves, we became dropouts.</p>
                    <p>But we did look back, we aimed to fix Education. To make all those
                      countless forgotten aches and pains count.</p>

                      <h2>We Changed The World</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>At first, nobody wanted to talk to us.</p>
                    <p>There was a problem with how Investors viewed people who paraded their GPA
                      or even completed schools.</p>
                    <p>The Investors didn&apos;t want followers, and above all they didn&apos;t want
                      cheaters that tried to pass their GPA as something authentic or even
                      meaningful.</p>
                    <p>The Investors sought Natural Born Leaders, they sought Evidence of
                      Exceptional Ability.</p>
                    <p>The Investors sought people who rejected the inauthenticity of broken
                      education and didn&apos;t partake in stupid charades.</p>
                    <p>It was almost like High School became a mechanism to keep the
                      administration busy, the teachers blind, the students poor, and the parents
                      dreaming.</p>

                      <h2>The Fierce &amp; Authentic</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Staying in school had a negative impact on our education, on our futures.
                      College and Premed brought sleep deprivation into the farce, it was a
                      dangerous joke.</p>
                    <p>In the end all we had was our friendship. The school was tearing us apart,
                      the Start-ups kept us together.</p>
                    <p>Looking back at how young we were, how unbreakable, how fierce.</p>
                    <p>Though we didn&apos;t believe in schools, we doubted ourselves for years. Now,
                      looking back, we searched for mentors, but none were to be found. But, in
                      the absence of teachers, we became the teachers.</p>
                    <p>To quote an old commercial: We were The Crazy Ones, The Misfits, The
                      Rebels, The Troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who
                      saw things differently, who were not fond of rules, and had no respect for
                      the status quo.</p>
                    <p>We were the ones crazy enough to think we could change the world...</p>
                    <p>... and we did ...</p>

Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
