                <p>Those who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,</p>

                <p>We must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,</p>

                <p>Endless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,</p>

                <p>will contribute back to the city and everyone&apos;s well being.</p>

                <p>What is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,</p>

                <p>Wisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a &quot;fake it until you make it&quot; trickery,</p>

              </section>
              <section>
                <p>The very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,</p>
                <p>we must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.</p>
              </section>

                <p>To honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,</p>
