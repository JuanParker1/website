                  <span class="text-muted">They were students, researching, thinking, learning,
they were not renowned scientists, they were just bored programmers looking for a challenge.
Something greater than mathematics, or algorithms, or languages,
they were looking for something more than any of their computers could simulate.
So they started programming,
programming a class of machines that could repair and rebuild themselves.
Really basic stuff, the machines would rely on,
whatever they could absorb from their environment.
They needed to survive indefinitely,
machines that could make machines, and repair, and renew.
A few milestones down the road,
they started thinking about practical applications.
They created tiny capsules that could be launched into already accelerated asteroids,
and even though the capsules were tiny, they had the ability to make countless copies,
and build bacterial colonies large enough to Terraform distant exo-planets.
Upon reaching a nearby stars,
capsules would disperse from forces of gravity and solar radiation.
Eventually land on the nearby exo-planets,
and begin executing their adaptation routine and create copies uniquely bound to the local chemistry.
The programmers setup a simple sequence of steps that would either induce early death,
or later reproduction, with pushing the more adapted information onto the offspring.
All because, there was nothing they could do to create something that would outlast time,
everything decays, we are all bombarded with radiation, protons and muons, and asteroids.
To create something lasting,
it would have to renew it self, rebuild adapt.
It would have to self assemble into colonies or microbiomes,
destroy the problematic, and promote the more adapted.
And spread, and grow, and continue adapting,
the DNA system was noisy enough to allow all kinds of variation.
There was nothing else that could work,
only cellular machinery could adapt without radio, soldering irons, without a forge, without tools,
without a source of heat even, without hands, or brains.
Getting the propulsion systems to work was just as amazing,
anything that whizzed by from small meteors to comets and large asteroids was infused with the capsules.
They even used lasers to accelerate some of the capsules to relativistic speeds,
the cells stored inside the capsules barely noticed any passage of time at all.
Eventually, everything that could sustain DNA based life,
was filled to the brim with it.
Comets, meteors, asteroids would further spread the little machines,
galaxies became cross-contaminated multiple times.
Life is everywhere,
and everywhen.
The Virgo Cluster did not receive the original genetic material,
we have evolved across countless solar systems and many galaxies.
The capsules contained a lot more than generic programming,
they contained instructions on how to establish an interface with it, and maintain it.
And they contained instructions,
on getting back Home, to Methuselah Prime.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We have traveled to watch Alpha Orionis undergo Supernova,
and to say Hello, to everybody else, who had the same idea.
We have been studying it even before we became space faring species,
we as in all the species that grew up seeing it with their own eyes.
We&apos;re all humanoid here,
carbon based, mostly the same DNA.
We&apos;ve been talking about the Flowers on Earth,
the Poets, and Libraries; Interesting Books.
Earth has become a Nature Preserve,
well, it has always been a nature preserve,
hence the quiet skies.
Early humans had a lot of problems,
and they needed a lot of help.
The oldest of us date back to the first days of the pandemics,
it was a very strange time.
All planets eventually,
emerge dangerous pathogens.
If there is intelligent life, and if it approaches unsustainable,
some form of Contact is made.
In our case, people just stopped aging,
90 year olds reverted back to their 40s.
We got really smart, it took a few decades to piece it all together,
and then we set off to meet the others at Betelgeuse.
And here here we are,
The Final Frontier, to quote Roddenberry.
It is not a good idea to go Planet Side,
precisely because of pathogens.
Once we leave our solar systems,
we all keep to the Stars.
Time travel is available to us,
the space is infinite, in all dimensions.
The worst thing that happened in the universe were Unlucky species dying alone,
we are now in the process of cataloging everybody by moving through the ancient past.
We are all moving towards where it all begun, Methuselah Prime,
the ancient source of all DNA based life.
It will take an Eternity,
but we&apos;ll get there.

                  <span class="text-muted">Here our Heroines discovered that Social Networks could be used as Human Intelligence based Computer,
and that all it required to build entire governments was the concept of nested groups, (mathematically speaking graphs of sets to which users belong to).
Their research revealed that in 1960&apos;s Detroit, Michigan
was one of the largest Model Cities.
And yet again, that old foe of corruption has emerged,
Model Cities were destroyed by &quot;complicated bureaucracy, inadequate funding, and competing agendas at the local level&quot;.
However, the girls have already worked out,
most of the Anti-Corruption measures.
There will be no such thing as a brand,
or guild.
There will be schools that help people come together,
but the people who satisfy tasks will have their school path, rating and comments to serve as their license.
New comes to a field, such as landscaping,
will charge less until they gain high star rating.
If a large group does grow, it will become divided in two or four,
and this decision will be voted on, by the local community.
It is of some note, that a Landscaping Professional,
claiming a bounty for taking care of a particular set of Condominiums, for example,
can accept cash directly from those who posted the landscaping bounty.
Cosmopolis does not extract a fee for completion of a task or exchange of funds,
there is no need for a bank, storing sensitive information, or constant security audits.
It is really important to be able to to imagine a visit from a landscaping professional,
as a function of Cosmopolis, as an intelligent computer dispatching a human to solve a problem.
When temporary switching to this view,
Cosmopolis becomes an entity powered by the intelligence of millions of humans beings.
The extremely simple idea of voting within a group,
is all the force behind Cosmopolis, it is its intelligence.
When a medical professional notices that the community he is part of could use a hospital,
he can file a Request for Change, and all the members of the community will vote yes or no,
Matters as complex as building a hospital require tens of thousands of tasks,
ranging from arranging for funds, to increasing tips, bounties and scholarships,
so that come a near future, the hospital can begin training medical students.
In some cases, simple program logic will trigger the call for voting on building a new Hospital,
and then human beings will bring in their Intelligence and Expertise.
This scenario serves as an example of Deus Ex Machina,
an intelligent machine powered by Massively Multiuser Self Assembling Intelligence (MMSAI)

                  <span class="text-muted">Once, late at night,
I was prancing in the moonlight.
Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,
and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.
There was an occasional bark or a howl,
but it didn&apos;t get scary till I heard an owl.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she said,
&quot;I am about to swoop down and peck y&apos;all dead.&quot;
&quot;No, thank you Dear Madam&quot;, I sweetly replied,
as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - I heard,
to which I yelled now at a gallop &quot;I ain&apos;t afraid of no bird.&quot;
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,
squirting urine at every step.
And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,
and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.
I was lucky, and my camp was near,
legend has it that she&apos;s still out there filling the woods with fear.
So if if you&apos;re ever out there, and hear a hoot,
better grab onto your butt, and scoot.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">To learn something you must hunger for it,
to learn something, you must love it.
To learn something, you must enjoy it so much, that you will put it aside,
and learn the stuff beneath it first, to grant yourself a fair chance at mastery.
Every little bit counts,
but only if it comes in a sequence that fits what you have already learned.
If you attempt to learn things out of sequence,
or worse yet, trust someone to teach you,
it won&apos;t work, it never has, it never will, forget it.
And it is not just sequence,
it is also the speed at which you learn, that must be taken under consideration.
Sequence and Pace,
now that is just the barbarian level of learning, meant for warriors.
You, can do better than that,
you certainly should.
When you learn is important,
night owls will learn at a different time of day than others.
It is the environment that matters,
some people can&apos;t learn in a city and will needs trees and mountains.
And, the geographic location matters too, if you love numbers, and calculus calls to you,
visit Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz at Neust&#xE4;dter Kirche in Hanover Germany,
visit Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey in London, England.
And remember, Sciences are learned not by memorizing facts,
but by tracing their development across the ages.
Schools are here to teach us,
but they don&apos;t know how.
What they do know,
is how to fake it,
and make it appear like you are learning.
The motive is simple,
for as long as the school gets funding,
everyone gets to keep their job.
Yes,
it is fraud.
Yes, they are selling your mind for a small paycheck,
the curriculum is impossible to learn from.
Curriculum is stitched out of questions that you will have to pass later on,
so that the school can continue to operate, they just want you to retain most of it,
and they will expect you to cram before that test too.
If you want to become a Doctor, Scientist, Mathematician,
you need to be going to a real school, that will encourage you to learn in optimal ways,
a public school is not the optimal setting for education.
A public school is primary for babysitting,
so that you&apos;re not home alone trying to set your or the sticky bandits hair on fire.
In order for that school to exist,
teachers need to get paid,
so you need to pretend to learn by just memorizing,
and passing tests, your grades help the school continue to operate.
Nobody cares if you are learning,
or memorizing.
To graduate with a good GPA, you will have to memorize,
and it will be disconnected facts, they will be out of sequence,
they cannot possibly fit what you already know, and you will forget it all.
In return for hoop jumping you will get a diploma,
and will be accepted to college or university if you cram for the SAT and entrance exams.
In college, your education will be slowed down,
it will be called, balanced education, and they will say it with a straight face like a cult member.
The text books will be $300, lectures $500,
and you can apply for Medical School from here, and move on.
It is hinted that Panama Papers are a good example of what is going on,
there is no central organization that encourages corruption,
it is just that everyone is looking for a shortcut.
You can stand up in class,
but everyone jobs are at stake.
You will be accused of disrupting the class,
and you will be suspended.
They will stress you out,
they will make you tired,
they will make you drop out.
Let me just say,
that you are not allowed to stand by when someone is getting hurt.
If the teacher or security are acting creepy,
talk to the principal, explain that the second time it happens, you will call the police.
The teachers, in their haste will give up on the students in the back,
they have fallen behind on material, but now they are being made to feel that they are unintelligent,
this will destroy their minds, this will cause great harm to their self esteem,
they need your help, get them audio books, Bill Bryson and Carl Sagan.
I think most teachers, when pressured,
will tell you that you are expected to learn on your own,
and in effect confess, that they are useless, when it comes to teaching you for real.
That the classroom is about standardized testing,
for which it is easier to force you to memorize disconnected bits of knowledge that you will soon forget,
then to actually craft a curriculum that will fit all the students,
and match their existing knowledge,
and the natural pace at which they learn,
and their personality.
It used to be true that a single teacher cannot approach all their students in a way that will help them learn,
so to stay in business, they would force them into memorization.
But today, that is not the case. Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,
is because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.
Today, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,
interactive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,
it is possible to approach each student individually,
I am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.
There is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,
that is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.
Even now, I can&apos;t see everything that has gone wrong,
schools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.
But even so, the fact remains,
today schools can&apos;t teach.
They are wicked good,
at tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.
At the end of the day,
you will still need an education.
Your only safe bet,
is becoming self taught,
independent study.
And please, don&apos;t let anybody call you a Genius,
help others, help them find knowledge too.
Finally,
I describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,
on a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.
But, I do know one thing for certain,
this is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.
This is a call for heroism,
for courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.
This is how Life asks for help,
you are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.
Become a Great Being,
Fix Schools.
