                  <span class="text-muted">Writing is like the spinning top in Inception,
it is a way to self evaluate.
If you continue being unable to write,
then it means you are surrounded by invisible walls.
Being able to lay down your favorite thoughts on a piece of paper,
and helping to inspire or enlighten someone, is a sign of health and inner-freedom, and in some cases Greatness.
There are many styles of writing,
and many directions.
My style of writing is patterned after poems,
I write two sentences per stanza, if I need a third sentence,
then it generally means I over-complicated something.
I think my favorite aim is to turn my little poems,
into little movies and stitch them together into a tiny documentary.
I&apos;ve heard of a project called Love Letters to Strangers
and I find that to be the sweetest aim of all.
In the larger scope,
we must all write to update the surface for future generations to stand on.
The books our parents read are great, by they are a bit old fashioned,
we have to, rebuild the library for the future generations.
We don&apos;t want the future to start with our parents,
we want them to start where we left off,
so that we may spare them the aches we went through.
Things change.
When we talked about climate 50 years ago,
there was still a chance to become educated about it and make informed decisions, today.
But, today, all we got is the observation that climate appears to have become more unstable,
and most are not educated enough to make any sense of it, or agree on any solution.
And that the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife is last 50 years,
people are too desperate for food, money, housing and health, to grasp what that means.
We need a new perspective on dealing with climate change,
because a world uneducated on the subject,
is a world that will never reach a consensus, and may never do anything about it.
Writing a book will tell you if you have the knowledge you think you do,
there are many teenagers, that feel they have mastered Quantum Physics; bless their Great Hearts and Beautiful Minds.
However, they can only write an assay or two,
they can&apos;t synthesize new ideas to fill a book.
Feeling smart is a very healthy sign, that a person is headed in the right direction,
but writing a book is a sign that they have traveled a considerable way there, and are of great health.
You can see what it means to be able to write a book much more clearly in this example in particular,
it means Freedom and Power of Mind, falling short is just... Dreaming.
There is a very powerful kind of book, that perhaps is most important,
and only a young person, during their youth can write it.
Brilliant Teenage Minds that made some headway in life,
writing advice to their peers, that have unfortunately gotten stuck, or fallen.
Opening ones heart at a young age, is a very noble thing to do,
it is a sign of Great Beauty, Compassion and Grand Heroism.
Those books, must not be judged by adults,
their creators must understand not to judge their creative writing by adult standards.
Adults are not what they seem, for one;
and second the people who benefit from those books are teenagers themselves.
A person who is suffering early in their life,
is best helped by the words of someone who has recently managed to rise out of similar problems.
Our youth is the most formative period of our life. Even the smallest of pains spared,
or littlest of mistakes avoided will have massive and profound influence over us, come our middle age.
Write,
write when you are young,
write when you are growing up,
write when nobody seems to be listening.
Write in the face of Liars,
write in the face pretenders, fakers, manipulators, wannabes, and fake-it-until-you-make-it morons.
Write to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps,
write to become a beacon
write to become a light of enlightenment.
Write to bring back what has been written a generation before,
if the story is worth the while, retell it, retell it countless times.
And when you are ready to lay down your pencil for the day,
read, read it out loud, and record it,
because the light in your voice is worth a million books.
And finally,
know what it is all for...
It is how the next generation learns from the previous one,
it is how they win the wars we could only hoped to have won.
It is how they become the heroes we hoped to be,
it is how they save the world, that we can&apos;t see.
Write, because that&apos;s how you! become the hero you hoped to be,
and because the world belongs to the future generations,
not just you and me.
Write.

                  <span class="text-muted">It is pretty embarrassing to be born into a world
where our dear politicians pointed atomic weapons at each other,
and celebrated the peace; that this brought to the world.
I will say that with broken schools or fake education,
we can&apos;t really have the culture in which language can express:
No more war,
please, turn off the rockets.
But that also means, by means of abstract thinking,
we are able to comprehend the Power of Prevention and Education.
By creating a Powerful and Fun, Educational System,
we can Prevent Stupid Ideas from holding the world hostage.
Personally, I think that Self Education
is always going to be better than any Organized Education.
It is always at the right pace, and in the right sequence,
there nothing to stress about, it is just a really beautiful adventure.
Once we feel we know enough, we can begin scribbling,
like I am doing right now.
There is no better way to become a good writer,
than by writing.
And what a fantastic thing it is to be able to package
out most favorite thoughts into little poems,
that page by page, become little books we can share.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Same things may have many different names,
and different things can be called by the same name.
Add liars, manipulators, pretenders,
the vengeful, greedy, and blind.
Add language barriers, national borders,
fake education, indoctrination, censorship,
misinformation, nationalism.
Add manipulation, disagreement, conflict, madness,
hate, apathy, desperation and stress.
Add weapons manufacturing,
and mutually assured destruction.
And there is no more common language left,
for exchange of important ideas.
Maybe there never was,
a common language.
Certainly, we must ensure,
that we do share a language.
Let us set the context, then,
we are an important chain-link,
in an endless progression of Human Generations.
You, are One of One Hundred Billion Human Beings,
to have ever lived.
Billions more will follow,
across millions of years ahead.
We are going to be here for so long,
that Evolution and Science will alter our very appearance.
Our actions will be Judged in the Courtroom of Time,
presided over by all the future generation.
Some, far in the future, may consider out modern times,
hardly distinguishable from Dark Ages.
We don&apos;t get old,
we grow wiser.
Many Great Beings repeat that,
&quot;Old age is a privileged denied to many&quot;.
And eventually,
we will take to the stars.
We are to live Happy, Authentic,
Fulfilling and Meaningful Lives.
There is no time for Lies or Babble,
but there is plenty of time for pursuits of excellence.
And time never stands still,
so much so that there is no such thing as business as usual.
The usual does not last long enough,
to become the norm.
We are to lead the way,
to rise to the challenges ahead.
And to move with such Magnificent Grace,
as to transcend the limits we didn&apos;t even notice we had.
Education and Culture,
is the only things that sets us apart,
from the beings of the Dark Ages.
We progressed out of those times,
by ever pushing forward and above.
By becoming more abstract thinkers,
and by using abstract thinking,
to solve problems,
by subtle analogy to other solutions.
The internet, is the first great step,
towards a Better World.
A world connected with devices,
capable of helping us communicate,
without a single bit of misunderstanding or distrust.
This clear communication interface of the future,
is but a simple engineering problem.
Perhaps, it is a symbolic user interface language,
perhaps a Virtual World,
perhaps a simulated City Government that grows to become the Planetary Government.
But certainly, it is near,
and it will not be stopped,
and it will be a source of truth,
and it will transcend borders,
and it will beam from the sky.
And there will be no room for lies,
no room for manipulations,
nothing to gain by weapons manufacturing,
nothing to gain by hoping to carve humanity with borders,
or deny basic rights.
It will slowly sneak up on those,
who would wish to stop it.
It will sneak up on them by means,
of their very own ignorance and arrogance.
In the world of the future,
we exist as One Humanity.
There is no poverty,
there is no hunger.
And our greatest aim,
is Great Health, Impossible Wisdom,
and simple Cheerfulness and Happiness and Joy.
Captains Log, Supplemental, September 13, 2820
There is a huge unmentionable Universal Debt,
that originally, by mistake, landed on a single credit card,
of an unsuspecting young lady in Belgium
- nobody knows why, including myself!
She was just born the year it happened,
so she didn&apos;t even need a card.
Someone just noticed that all debt was being charged to her account,
never said anything, and somehow, it stayed that way, for many hundreds of years afterwards.
Once she became legally obliged to do something about her debt circa 2040,
it was just cheaper to ignore the account, than to print the bill,
not to mention the bills needed to pay it off.
Notably some decades later,
arguably the most valuable human being on Earth,
would sweetly joke that she was the Most Worthless One.
She&apos;s been paying for everyone&apos;s food,
including all the pizzas economists eat,
so no one dared to say a thing for ages.
Hundreds of years later,
the new generations just assumed,
money was invented to be helpful (certainly not hurtful),
and that Little Chlo&#xE9; was the original inventor.
We are one family, after all,
there is no need to go hungry - never was.
It is of some note, that the most expensive thing she paid for,
was the first Star Ship, the Asteroid class Ark that begun colonizing the Milky Way.
That age was marked by our crossing from Homo Sapiens, to Homo Deus,
and the Star Ship was named, after none other than our little Chlo&#xE9;.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">A system of institutions is like a collection of computer programs,
where each program relies on the other for valid information.
Cities are powered by institutions, and when institutions go bad,
the entire city suffers; similar to how a computer will begin misbehaving.
The central processing unit of an institution, is people working within its walls,
it is a human powered computer, unlike machines, human based computers can self-repair.
A small and common example of a Human Powered computer is the modern Trash Truck,
the one that only has the driver operating that huge claw.
Another example is an unmanned aircraft,
whose operator is somewhere on the ground.
And a more down to the ground example is the modern supermarket Self-Checkout,
whenever the customer has a problem, the computer system will actually dispatch a human being for help.
Finally, the first known instance of a Human Powered Machine is the Turk,
it was a 1770 Chess Playing machine hoax, that had the operator hiding inside.
Here I bring attention to Failure, where the Education System,
is no longer operating, and thus causing stress, depression, poverty and desperation.
On the scale of a city when Education fails, it will cause an increase in crime,
and a city will begin filling its jails with those who were pushed to a breaking point out of desperation.
When institutions of a system such as a city begin failing,
all institutions are negatively affected.
Therefore it is in the best interest of all institutions to ensure integrity across the city,
and when that equilibrium can no longer be reached others, need to be artificially powered down.
For example we can&apos;t fail students and then start sending them to jail,
we have to scale the Justice System in proportion to how well the schools an other related systems are operating.
And wait for all to reach a healthy equilibrium.
We cannot perform business as usual, on one end, when the other is broken,
that can only further destabilize the system and cause even more damage.
The institutions of a city must not isolate themselves from reality,
the reason why we are not replacing Human Powered Institutions with Mere Machines, is Heart.
The Heart,
and Love for the citizen.
For a city to be called a city, and not a heartless machine for forcing human beings into desperation,
the poor, uneducated, ill, and homeless, must come first, they must be granted safe homes, medical care, and welfare.
A city must be judged by what happens to the least fortunate,
way out on the borders that most tend to look away from.
Then; we must practice Crime Prevention by means of a Functional Real Education Systems,
that use the city&apos;s funds to help its students out of poverty by helping them to operate small businesses,
as a way of investing into its own not so distant future.
In a city without of balance,
&quot;the best we can&quot; may often become &quot;the worst we&apos;ve had.&quot;
We must practice preferential treatment for the disadvantaged,
for the uneducated, for those in dire need, and for the ill.
Let us call this:
Love Above Law,
The Future, and Future Generation demand,
that the Justice System learns to see,
because it is not meant to be a blind machine.
It was never about business as usual,
because time, never, stood still.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We must repair schools,
and finally put an end to ideas like listen and repeat and short term memorization.
The first and foremost is the elimination of grades,
which also means elimination of standardized testing.
There cannot be such a thing as a Standard Human,
with a standard mind, it is very foolish to think that.
The second is the division of subjects,
and that is no different than browsing the World Encyclopedia.
Eventually, people who arrive at Gene Editing,
will choose their own path through Biology.
Eventually, those who take to building Software,
will create a path through languages and concepts that fit them best.
Same for every other subject...
Mathematics can be studied from an enormous number of starting points,
from Color Theories, and Music and Sound Processing,
to 3D Printing, Game and Game Engine Design, Astrobiology, Cryptanalysis and Combinatorial Genomics,
it is not presented as an aim, but rather a small stepping stone in a familiar context, and thus much more easily mastered.
Once a student displays a long term curiosity for a subject,
they will choose to be tested and choose to follow industry standards,
they will also choose an evolving test program to which they themselves may contribute.
As a whole, that creates their own Study Curriculum,
Curriculum Vitae, Resume and Job Posting.
The student moves at their own pace,
leaving an open trail that can be reviewed by prospective employers,
teachers, fellow researchers, and employers willing to pay for their study.
Certain paths can carry a Bounty, or Monetary Tips, Recurring Monetary Encouragement,
and above all creates a point into which the Government, City or Community, can invest.
This is an Open School where anybody can come,
where anybody can begin excelling at a subject that they are interested in.
Many may start with traditional subjects like Mathematics,
but here mathematics is presented with connecting points to various industries, and scholarships.
The software program behind this system will be kept purposefully simple and open,
it is after-all very similar to World Encyclopedia with a Blockchain for purposes of Scholarships and Path Funding.
The software will discourage disconnected clusters in hopes of bringing Humanity together to a single Truth we can all agree on,
as this an important requirement for dealing with Elimination of Poverty, Improvement of Education, Repair of Climate, and Prevention of Mass Incarceration.
Let us hope that this school will quickly become a Point of Cultural Convergence on Wisdom and Good Ideas,
a place for sharing Study Paths, Preservation of Knowledge, and a Fine Exit from Poverty by Means of Self Education and Pursuit of Excellence.
The Nations that Choose to Invest in This School to Help with Scholarship Programs,
will be investing in nothing less than the very Future of Human Kind.
One Family,
United In Wisdom.</span>
