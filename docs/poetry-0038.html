        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Three.</p>
        <p>Days pass by quickly, but as all the clocks tick away,<br>
          we mustn&apos;t keep our minds at bay.</p>
        <p>We each have extraordinary powers,<br>
          and we can expand our knowledge,<br>
          in just a few hours.</p>
        <p>All it takes is a video lecture,<br>
          or maybe an audio-book,<br>
          you don&apos;t even have to look.</p>
        <p>Hours add up, day by day,<br>
          building, a new passageway.<br>
          It is knowledge that sets us free.</p>
        <p>And our inheritance from great beings,<br>
          is the key.</p>
        <p>We mustn&apos;t forget, that everyone needs to learn,<br>
          not merely listen, but break out of their prison,<br>
          and rise to greatness, when theirs is the turn.</p>
        <p>It is within us, that each great being should return,<br>
          it is how the world grows, it is how you get your turn.</p>
        <p>So, rise to their height, inherit their might,<br>
          shine the brightest of light,<br>
          yours is the future, yours is the fight.</p>
