what I am about to say.
Yes,
it is all connected.
You can learn the Melbourne Shuffle nearly instantly,
if you start with Alan Walker&apos;s Faded.
There is a springy sound in between the beat past the intro,
that&apos;s where you contract your core, that&apos;s the middle step,
that divides mere shuffling feet; from actual Melbourne Shuffle.
The only other thing you have to remember,
is that the leg you lift goes forward, and then you switch legs.
The sound controls your body,
start with a slower song or a different genre and it will be a lot harder,
for a person who is just starting, it may be too hard to try to dance to a different song.
And music is basically a program,
it is just Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies assembled into a song.
You can easily break down Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies into their structure,
you can hear it in your ear, you can write it down on paper, in color, with squiggles and emphasis.
But there is a better way, even better than LMMS,
and that is programming.
A song you program can play forever,
and the programming language that you learn along the way, is actually a method for interfacing with technology,
The GUI is a very slow method of controlling computers,
the command line, automation of the command line, and writing commands you can use and automate,
is the first, and really the only way to get computers to work for us, not against us.
And on the other spectrum, you can write a program,
that will control your dance, the very way you move.
It is all connected, Sam Aaron is correct in his analogy,
we don&apos;t learn to write to become book authors, we just need it,
and we don&apos;t learn programming to sit in an office cubicle all day long,
We do it to save day,
to save some time,
and to dance that time away.

                  <span class="text-muted">The distance between Science and Play, between Adventurer and Scientist,
approaches zero will approach zero in proportion to just how much fun you are having.
My first independent invention was a CD based Car MP3 player in 1998,
there were many other mp3 player patents, dating many years back, I didn&apos;t invent anything new.
My second invention about 10 year later, was a freaking star-ship,
and it was safe to teenagers fly.
It was a high altitude balloon with a miniature craft that would beam down video and movement of the platform,
to a trailer down on the ground where the crew would be experiencing all the motion in near real time.
Once the balloon pops it would be possible to the dismay of the FAA, and evey other three letter agancy,
to attempt to stair it, the kids in the trailer on the ground would be getting real feedback to whatever the heck they were trying to do.
Once someone slams the deploy parachute button,
the miniature craft would slow its descent, the trailer would shudder.
My third invention, from just not too far back was a board game,
but a fascinating one.
Amazon sells see through acrylic padlocks, and deadbolts for locksmith training,
and I realized that one could create a little game out of them.
Basically the players would have to lock-pick their way through the game,
they would each receive a little lock picking kit, which is the real deal.
As a bonus the last door they would have to pick,
was the door to their own house.
This would teach the players to find a quality lock,
and actually help them in real life.
And just now, I am toying with the extremely CPU intensive post processing of photographs,
I was just able to bring color to an infrared photo taken in the middle of the night.
There are no practical applications,
I am just looking towards astrography, contemplating the milky way.
Toying with a program called ZeroMQ,
it is just meant to send information between programs and commuters,
but I can also see that it could control a large array of cameras and I am just wondering what that could mean for slow motion,
super resolution, and things like home made supernovae detection software.
It is all fun and games, I am hardly programming any of this, and it is all just about as unscientific as it can be,
but it does help with day dreams, having a bold idea, and looking into it, teaches something.
This kind of exploratory learning, or self education,
if far more powerful than reading textbooks, or listening to lectures.
Do not be afraid of imagining interesting things,
take to the microscope, infrared and thermal imaging.
I think self education is the only way to make the world a better place,
treat school for what it is, and don&apos;t let it stand between you and real knowledge, and fun.

                  <span class="text-muted">I think that is how the great thinkers learned in the past,
they would grab onto something like Gravitation, Electromagnetism, Pendulums,
and try to figure out how they worked, what forces influenced the things they observed.
Inventing and Invention, makes us think of Pet Rocks, Chia Pets, and Cheap Junk,
but the true meaning of invention is following your path of curiosities.
For example, aren&apos;t you curious about Infrared Photography?
Infrared Lamps that but emit a faint red color, but light up an IR Photo,
Infrared Camera for Raspberry PI Zero costs $12, and the UNIX based Raspberry PI Zero just about $20,
Raspberry PI contains a couple commands with dozens of options that you can tinker with,
from ISO, shutter speed, to options like brightness and contrast.
Just a simple curiosity can lead you on a path of exploring UNIX,
Photography, the Light Spectrum, and even let you brush against Astrography.
Where you get to think about flaws in your Charge Coupled Device (CCD Sensor),
and how you have to hunt down and eliminate the dead pixels.
And what great please it is to see that your photos are flawless,
and then begin stacking them to average out and remove noise,
all these little triumphs add to your Knowledge and Wisdom.
It is OK to be overwhelmed, but it is not OK to shy away from something that captured your interest because it seems too confusing,
the confusion just comes from not knowing all the steps to get to taking your first IR photo.
Start with the $150 8GB Raspberry PI 4, get a couple of monitors,
and create your first laboratory.
Then get the $20 Raspberry PI Zero, and you&apos;ll have your first computer network,
with a satellite Raspberry Zero, that only requires power, so it just needs a single cable.
Attach the Noir Camera to it,
and start exploring what it means to average images to eliminate noise.
Another Raspberry Zero,
this time with a normal $9 camera, can watch your flowers with time laps photography.
This is an example of a modern path of invention,
from this point on, you get to choose your own next steps.
You can study Node.js, UNIX, Bash, and become a programmer,
you can move on beyond the digital and buy your first $200 DIY 3D Printer,
and for example print cases for your Raspberry PIs.
After some practice with the servo motors,
you can build a Raspberry Powered Telescope,
that also doubles as a Deadly Space Laser, hey you never know, it is 2020 after all.
This is how the Great Beings that invented the experiment of mandatory public education, learned.
Baby Step, by Baby Step.
traveling a decades long journey with with curiosities and adventures.
A journey where every new step adds to the previous,
to create a body of Knowledge and Wisdom.
When you feel you hit a milestone, write a tutorial on how you did it,
on what you improved, make some video tutorials, and put them on your resume,
show your inventors or employer that you know that your mind has no limits,
and that you are a Brilliant Inventor, and a Fine Scientist.

                  <span class="text-muted">You are a great inventor, invention is something we do naturally,
but you need to detox from all the hustle and bustle of busy life.
Your private inventions usually build on something someone else did,
so social networks, websites, photography, and maybe art.
If you just sit down with something that fascinates you,
and play with it, you are bound to invent something new.
Let us start with a silly example,
You could create a custom phone ring service, where people yell names...
so when someone calls Alan, the phone actually screams for him.
And here your invention would be about how your relate to voice artists, what tools you give them,
would you also create an addition where the phone yells the name of the person that is calling.
Something more serious would be a social network that takes all your weekly posts,
and creates a part of a chapter in your memoir, here the users can order a paper hard copy,
you could customize this idea by providing beautifully bound books that feature posts from many users,
and you may even simply rely on existing social networks.
Not all starting points require the internet,
or complexity for that matter.
Do you know about Spin Art,
if you could invent a personal touch, maybe something to do with 3D features, or thread,
every Dentist&apos;s Office would feature your fantastic art, your signature, and website address,
and you could even publish a coffee book about your art.
For something less abstract consider building a tilt-shift photography service,
where you get a little drone to fly up to get a giant&apos;s view, and take the most fascinating photos,
for weddings, real-estate, even newspaper articles.
For something more startling, you could start with macro photography,
now entering a realm that everyone can&apos;t help but to be fascinated with,
enormous six foot canvas featuring tiny bugs.
You could even go deeper and do Photomicrography,
and here you enter a world that very few people think about, some may even find your photos unbelievable,
this kind of work would get you featured in national galleries.
If you don&apos;t like still photography, consider setting up cheap time laps cameras all over the place,
and then sell them as background video for speeches, or poetry, or add classical music and call it a new way to hear it,
or call it the study of passage of time, and make a documentary about it, to get at your first Oscar.
Not all inventions need to make money or fame,
but all inventions must fascinate you.
They have to call to your soul,
to your health, to your curiosity.
You have thousands of ideas in your mind,
slow down, get in touch with your Inventive Side,
and help the world become more beautiful.

                  <span class="text-muted">My Friends,
No century is ordinary, and such is the case with this one,
you have a little bit of work to do, you may need to slow down with school and work a bit.
You will be creating a series of books about Real Education, Governing the World,
Human Rights, and a beautiful Survey Course half-jokingly entitled, The Human Manual.
Today computers are everywhere, and they hold a powerful potential,
one that can enhance Education, The Voter and Democracy,
one that can simplify bureaucracies and Governments.
Humanity has been greatly enhanced by the experiment of mandatory education and free access to knowledge,
but the systems of standardized education have fallen behind on times,
we must now use computers to cater to individual students,
and to remove the need of grades, replacing it with a simple history of self chosen subjects.
This a great endeavor,
for which few are ready.
As it always happens in Human History,
this challenge has been pressed upon our shoulders all too soon,
it has been accelerated by Climate Change, Anthropocene Extinction, Mass Incarceration,
and Needles Borders that uselessly Divide our Human Family.
This century a Divided Humanity is a Weak Humanity,
to face all the challenges and to ready the Younger Generations to carry on,
we must unite, the Internet has been Ready for years now.
What follows is an imperfect outline,
of much needed works that aim to Strengthen Humanity,
and help all the children with all the challenges they are soon to face.
Book One: Real Education,
this is a choose your own adventure type experience, that is to be published as a Paper Book,
as an Audio Book, as a Video Book, and finally taught in schools as a series of lectures.
This is very important, My Friends, in 2020, at the time of writing this document,
schools were unable to teach students, they would only force them into memorization,
the motive was to receive state funding so that all school employees would get paid.
(Much will be said on this subject, but much of it won&apos;t matter,
because efficacy of education is _not_ judged by its collective test scores and trends,
but rather; results. Its positive impact on the Voter, and City, State, and Nation Governments,
and above all the well being of our Planet.)
Book Two: Governing The World,
is a book about establishing a Computer Program Managed Democracy,
it is very much an augmented reality, a mirror of our world where our voices count for more.
The program harnesses the Wisdom of the Educated Humanity;
for City, State, Nation, and Earth management.
It is worth noting that it is to have its beginnings as a Interactive Fiction game,
that is collaboratively expanded, much like the world encyclopedia.
Book Three: Human Rights,
is a volume detailing stories about growing up in the world,
it is just essays that highlight what people can do to help the World Grow,
and how to go about it to become triumphant.
This book speaks about a path to a United Humanity,
it is not just about putting an end to the idea of borders as the European Union so nobly demonstrates,
but it is about getting ready to commit all ideas that result in dividing us to history books,
and accepting the fact that we are just one family, that we are the Wise Caretakers of Earth and all of Her Inhabitants.
Human Rights must also highlight the problem of inequality that leads to Incarceration,
people are going to prisons due to lack of Education and Knowledge.
Due to Stress, Poverty. Mental Disorders and Illness some of which is rooted in Neurological Disorders born from poverty, addiction, and unsafe environments.
Prisons must be replaced with Schools,
Human beings do not belong in cages.
Furthermore,
The first and foremost purpose of a Government is to end poverty, homelessness, hunger, and sickness to the best of our abilities.
This means a Universal Basic Income, real money indistinguishable from a paycheck earned by hard work.
People who face Poverty, Hunger, Homelessness, treatable Illness,
who feel isolated or excluded, will be unable to study and comprehend these great Works of Love that this text describes.
We are One Family, we need their help, we need all of Humanity to permanently come together and leave bad ideas behind.
Book Four: The Human Manual,
Is a Book of world&apos;s most inspirational and beloved essays.
It contains the following;
cheerful chapters for Mighty Five Year Olds,
inspiring essays for the Unstoppable Ten Year Olds,
a loving introduction to the complexity of the world for Fifteen Year olds,
and powerful and moving lessons for Teenagers and Twenty-somethings, lessons that many Thirty and Forty Year olds will lovingly return to.
These works are not meant to be set in stone,
the doors to new essays, submissions, and repairs, will always be open.
They are to be translated into all the languages spoken today,
in order to encourage global communication and unity.
These works, are works of the Universal Human Love,
of Human Beings finally coming together to form a Single United Family.
As a United Humanity,
we can easily face all the challenges ahead.</span>
