                  <span class="text-muted">Each lesson must add to the next one,
we hardly need to push ourselves.
It sooo important that you start with something you like,
it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.
There area always extras that come alongside,
and they change everything.
Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,
maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.
Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,
you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.
I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,
but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.
Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,
it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.
A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,
sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.
One example that comes to mind is the Ohm&apos;s Law,
you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.
Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,
you can&apos;t connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.
So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,
then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.
Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,
you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.
You see what the problem is, of course,
in schools, they don&apos;t teach by means of practical applications.
They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,
which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.
If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,
and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.
But they don&apos;t do that,
we have to do that.
And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,
it is all those little things we are interested in.
And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,
they won&apos;t know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.
See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,
so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.
And then come our retirement, we&apos;ll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,
and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.
It is the only way the world can grow,
and there is much growing up ahead of us.

                  <span class="text-muted">That is the law, above all laws,
that is the rule above all rules.
That is the advice, above all advice,
that is the last sacred wisdom.
The adults can have whatever they want, and a full measure of happiness,
so as long as it does not interfere with your rise to greatness.
Whatever stands in your way, gods, royalty, governments and armies, laws,
traditions, parents, friends, schools, fairy tales, and curfews.
Is null and void,
by the power of the Universe, by the power of Reality.
Do you hear me?
all that matters is that you become a Great Being and Help Humanity Grow.
And armies will come to twist and lie, deport and enslave,
warp and punish, judge and sentence.
But they do not fight you,
they fight reality.
Those who fight reality,
can only destroy themselves.
You, you begin,
by inheriting reason and wisdom.
Whether you rise in camps, prisons or battles,
school libraries, or by shouting poems at the cafeteria.
Wisdom is the first and foremost,
and what must follow; is your rise to greatness.
Do not fear armies that are marching towards sure self-destruction,
instead Honor Humanity by becoming a Great Being.
And when you, reach your golden age,
remove that which stands in the way of the generations that are to follow.
Because, the world belongs to the children,
and the generations that are yet to come.
You must rise to Greatness,
by whatever means fit you best.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each time someone loses belief in themselves,
the world becomes a darker place.
The bad people are sick and broken,
they only have as much power as you give them.
The more you grow in strength,
the weaker, they become.
Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,
we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.
The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,
the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.
The bad people are only broken children, they can&apos;t grow,
they do not know that a Human, can only rise, when hurt.
Humans are born warriors,
our minds were forged in battle.
We are also philosophers,
each of our hardships, becomes a breathtaking page in our memoir.
No ache, ever goes wasted,
it becomes sacred and inspired wisdom to help others rise.
The only way for Humanity to grow,
is for each and every Human to become a Great Being.
Your struggles are a call to Heroism,
become a teacher, and help Humanity learn.
Greatness, is the new adulthood,
Greatness, is Humanity&apos;s Health.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">When you think about life decade by decade,
you can see that it is best lived by following an upward slope.
Each decade should be powerful for us,
it should propel us forward and beyond.
We must really take the time to consider what is important,
what is it that our elder selves may regret not having done.
Life does come with an instruction manual,
it is all the Audio Books that will interest you.
From Memoirs, to Adventure, and Science,
and also reading in-between the lines.
Above all, we must take good care of ourselves,
life is not meant to be lived in stress, or fear, or at a great speed.
This is how we can understand those books,
and learn from them and inherit their wisdom.
We are each a miracle of the universe,
the GPA, the championship or scholarship, just does not matter.
Listen to those words,
IT DOES NOT MATTER!
Because you are already more,
than any of that made up stuff!
It is not the brand of education that matters,
what matters, is that your education, brought you wisdom!
With wisdom, if you still need to,
you will build your own Firm, or Company, or School.
Pursuit of Wisdom, guarantees that as each decade passes,
you will grow in Greatness.
With Wisdom, and the transcendence of limits it entails,
come our golden age, we will become far more, than we thought possible.
The most prestigious degree, is the honorary degree,
where a University goes out of its way to deliver it to you,
for all your achievements, and the goodness you brought to the World.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">You are more than a student, or employee,
you are more than what you have, and even more than your dreams.
But oh my gosh, it is so easy to forget how special we all are,
fall to daily routines, and carrots and sticks and stones.
Two weeks of vacation for a little adventure is not enough
to push stress back and remember how beautiful we all are.
We have to try very hard not to lose ourselves in work,
in stress, in deceptions, in toxic situations.
Listen, just because you CAN - if you go all out to get that promotion,
or GPA, or diploma, it does not mean you should.
Because, you MUST make room for Sunshine, and Starry Nights,
for little adventures allover the place, and then some.
Your well being is not to be sacrificed for any reason,
no matter who is telling you that you must, must, must!
No, just say no,
and go.
Go, on the worlds most perfect adventure,
one that lasts a long time, and starts with a tiny shopping expedition,
But also carries on for days, maybe weeks,
a visit to every antique store along the way to buy the cheapest but cutest thing.
So cute, that NOBODY will question you needing it,
but so CHEAP, that everyone will say &quot;Oh wow, it is already old!&quot;
And then make expeditions to get ice cream,
and sausages, and why not buy a White Chocolate Cookies And Creme candy bar, why not in deed.
And continue on, mounting expeditions for fossils, and minerals,
a lighthouse, a beach far and yonder, chipmunk photos, and firewood.
All the while, remembering, and sometimes discovering,
who you are, where you are headed in life, and what it will be like when you arrive.
I... like driving at night,
because it seems safer.
I pack my gear in the afternoon,
I make sure to have water and some canned goods.
I wait until early Monday morning,
2AM or so, connect my GPS and go.
It takes about 3.5 hours to get there,
I always listen to the The Four Horsemen Discussion couple of times.
I discovered the Ludington State Park,
by just following highways and big roads.
It is really easy to get there,
take I-275 North, and follow I-96 West they kind of connect with an arc.
Then after hours and hours,
then take exit 1B to merge onto US-31 North, that takes you to the city limits.
Then when you run out of road,
take a left on US-10 that will take you in to Ludington.
Please drive carefully,
try to bring many friends along.
I always arrive early,
so I take a small nap in the Meijer parking lot.
Upon my awakening I go get some Ice Cream,
and shop around for Fanny Packs.
And, I always make sure to have mosquito sticks,
the thick ones that you light on fire, watch for that ash if you try to move one.
You drive west through Ludington,
there is a huge parking lot and a beach like no other.
Please ignore the signs that say &quot;DO NOT FEED SEAGULLS&quot;,
they are starving and need all your breadcrumbs.
I always watch sunsets, but when I parked at that beach, got ready, and put my sunglasses on,
some cute couple started making fun of me for how seriously I take the whole ordeal.
Perhaps it is just better to keep slowly driving north,
towards the State Park.
I always do, my office is there, for one,
right on that little parking lot when the dunes start, it is, a good view.
I remember one time I caught a nap there too,
waking up to an endless horizon was quite an awakening, that for sure.
Well you know how it is, State Parks are not free,
and it is best to book a Jack Pine Hike-in Site ahead of time.
As you keep going north, you can pay on the left where the campers go,
or you can just keep going and pay by the gate.
Park, disembark, and get ready to haul everything to your hike-in site,
watch out for owls.
Once you are there, set up camp, get some squeaky water out of the pump,
and get all the firewood you can find.
I always bring a hand saw with me,
I don&apos;t mess around when it comes to firewood.
And then hop over the dune,
there is a paradise out there, and you have to build something out of the drift wood.
The little lighthouse in the distance,
that&apos;s the Big Sable Point Lighthouse.
They sometimes hire people to work in their gift-shop,
and apparently give them a little apartment up there; sounds lonely to me.
Every time you come back from a little adventure,
and see that &quot;JACK PINE CAMPGROUND HIKE-IN SITES&quot; sign, it will feel like coming back home.
Jack Pine is a wonderful place,
aim to stay there a month if you can.
Move from site to site,
stay a day at the State Park, shower and come back to Jack Pine until you had enough.
Finally, when it is time to leave Jack Pine,
grab a pine cone to remember it by, and head to Nordhouse, just for a day or two.
They have a metal box you slip a few dollars into to get a parking permit,
and you&apos;ll have to hike a bit to get to the Wideness area, but it will be worth it.
It is so beautiful, that you may wish to stay longer than a couple of days,
you can walk the woods via Arrowhead Trail, or take the beach.
Watch for breaks in the grass,
that usually means there is a neat campsite out there.
Jack Pine will always feel very welcoming,
Nordhouse is a bit wilder.
You will have sand in your gear, and car for months,
hopefully to last you a whole winter so that you may get a refill come spring.
I say the Nordhouse sand brings good luck, and good memories,
when you are stressed out in a hurry, and notice there is still some sand left...
It will put things in perspective,
take you back to your latest camping adventure for a moment, help you slow down.
And above all, remind you to tidy up your gear,
give that old tent a sniff and see if you need to order a new one.
Before you know it,
it will be ample time to head on out there again.
One of the healthiest things we can do,
is sync up with the sun... go to sleep at sundown and get up at sunrise.
Another is to always make sure,
we have plenty of room in our life to read or listen to books.
And most importantly, Nature,
the bird song,
the chipmunk squeaks,
the crisp air,
the rich woodland fragrance of moss, fern and bear,
the building of a fire,
swimming in the lake,
exploring ancient dunes,
aimlessly collecting fossils and cute pebbles by the beach,
watching a beautiful storm in the distance,
searching for arrowheads...
...suddenly popping into the nearby gas-station to get more ice cream and sausage,
and then getting back to the camp, for another long and starry evening,
and slowly falling asleep, just to wake up to a another healing day.
Never forget your dreams,
never forget who you are.
Never, overwork yourself,
just because you can it does not mean you should.
We are far too beautiful to treat ourselves cogs in a machine,
we are meant to grow, and bloom, and inspire, and move entire generations.
We are so good at learning, and understanding, and mastering knowledge,
that past a few books, the undiscovered country beacons.
We are a young civilization,
do not let that push you around.
You are to discover your path to becoming a Great Being,
and help the world grow in Wisdom and in Peace.
