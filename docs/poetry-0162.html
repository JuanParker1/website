          <p>Do not let unfairness crush or burden you,<br>
            rise up against it, and speak out.</p>
          <p>Do not let anyone or anything make you feel tired,<br>
            tiredness will cloud your judgment until it is too late.</p>
          <p>Do not let anything stand between you and sunshine,<br>
            the morning dew, the sleepy meadow, the red sunsets.</p>
          <p>Do not let heartless cowards sell you on a cheap victory,<br>
            a True Warrior begins with wisdom, and grows inside out.</p>
          <p>Learn to recognize the influence of isolation, fatigue, fear,<br>
            and let it fade, as it is not part of your personality.</p><br>
          <p>Let go,<br>
            of past mistakes.</p>
          <p>Learn to recognize that the younger you, was doing the best they thought they could,<br>
            but with less wisdom, less knowledge, less awareness, and less experience.</p>
          <p>Growing up creates a great wall between the mistakes you might have made in your youth,<br>
            and the much wiser person you are today.</p>
          <p>Dear Reader, if you - as you are today, <strong>would not</strong> do the same as the younger you,<br>
            then you need to stop blaming yourself; it is not <em>your</em> fault anymore.</p>
          <p>Do, whatever else you must do to grow strong,<br>
            and turn your attention to the world, and to the future.</p><br>
          <p>The future generations need help with their thoughts, with their concept of the world.<br>
            With the interpretation of their intellectual inheritance; history, books, stories, poems.</p>
          <p>Help them avoid or overcome,<br>
            help them <strong>see</strong> the world better.</p>
          <p>Use your hard earned wisdom,<br>
            to <strong>add</strong> to the world.</p><br>
          <p>The children need your help, your wisdom, your knowledge, your experiences,<br>
            so that they can learn faster, avoid mistakes, see more, envision new heights.</p>
          <p>Do not let children start at the same height you started,<br>
            do not push them to repeat the same path you already traveled.</p>
          <p>The world can only grow,<br>
            when the new generation, stands on the shoulders of the one that came before it.</p>
