                <p>Nothing is what it looks like,</p>
                <p>because Human Beings, are not of the world of sequentially predictable machines.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Human Beings emerged, out of infinitely increasing complexity,</p>
                <p>by rules of infinite accidents along lines of fuzzy principles.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>In a word, we are here because the Universe mixed it self for so long</p>
                <p>that the failure for life to occur became inconceivable.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>And, we want to believe life emerged, on Earth,</p>
                <p>just like we wanted to believe that earth was the center of the Universe.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>And we want to believe that Earth was the first to have life,</p>

              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Universe is a large place, that has been around for a long time,</p>
                <p>it is better not to think of anything cosmic, as that! special.</p>

                <p>But there is one exception.</p>

              <section>
                <p>Once you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,</p>
                <p>that is no longer a common occurrence.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>There is nothing normal about it,</p>
                <p>we are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>No machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.</p>

              <section>
                <p>Nothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,</p>
                <p>nothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.</p>

                <p>We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,</p>

              </section>
              <section>
                <p>But that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,</p>
                <p>born of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.</p>

                <p>Focus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,</p>

                <p>When we need recall, we can have it in full,</p>

              <section>
                <p>Every window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,</p>
                <p>we don&apos;t have memory problems, we don&apos;t need better brains.</p>

              <section>
                <p>The convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,</p>
                <p>but combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Without that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,</p>
                <p>into the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.</p>

              <section>
                <p>By not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,</p>
                <p>there grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.</p>

              <section>
                <p>They add to get more, they take to be more,</p>

              </section>
              <section>
                <p>They think they are a cog, in a bigger machine,</p>

                <p>It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,</p>
                <p>but it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>It actually isn&apos;t OK to do things to simplify,</p>
                <p>complexity only moves in one direction.</p>

              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Complexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,</p>
                <p>we cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.</p>

                <p>The World must Go Forward, Move Forward,</p>
                <p>what needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,</p>
                <p>and wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Wisdom is a product of Love,</p>
                <p>not the Beating Heart, but the Human Capacity to Love the Universe, The World, and The Human Family.</p>

                <p>Becoming a Great Being, becoming Wise and Enlightened,</p>
                <p>is the actual definition of being an Adult.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Pretending to be an Adult, by acting mature,</p>
                <p>is to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Throwing away your Sweetens, and Foolishness, and Innocence, and all the Smiles that happen for no reason.</p>
                <p>That&apos;s not growing up, that&apos;s the worst thing you can do to your self, and is probably very unhealthy.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>To become an Adult,</p>
                <p>is to become a Philosopher.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Philosophy is about Loving Wisdom,</p>
                <p>is your Wisdom not the most precious thing within you?</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Universe, the biggest thing there is, in all it&apos;s might and complexity,</p>
                <p>a thing so powerful, that it may in some part, travel around it self in time.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>It can&apos;t do wisdom, best it can do is Evolution,</p>
                <p>but it can&apos;t do wisdom, it cannot know, it doesn&apos;t know such a thing could exist.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>And each and every one of us has the capacity for it,</p>
                <p>a volitional faculty to bring up a folder of your Noblest Thoughts.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>You are more powerful than the Universe,</p>
                <p>the only thing that can keep you down,</p>
                <p>is you never becoming aware of your Great Power.</p>

                <p>I know Superman comes to mind when you think of Superpowers and Superheroes,</p>

              </section>
              <section>
                <p>If Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,</p>
                <p>and build Schools to prevent War a Hundred Years before it happened.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>He&apos;d then age, so that the Little Ones,</p>
                <p>would listen to him without dismissing him as a Genius that lives on cloud nine.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>He&apos;d then let the little ones build with a thousand minds,</p>
                <p>what his one mind, couldn&apos;t grasp.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>The greatest of superheroes, would encourage us to build things,</p>
                <p>that help the world to converge,</p>
                <p>on Cultures of Wisdom that leave bad ideas behind.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>I ask you, My Dear Readers,</p>
                <p>to begin moving towards becoming Great Wise Beings,</p>
                <p>towards growing up by means of searching for wisdom,</p>
                <p>growing all the way up so that you stand as Authentic Adults.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>And rising to the challenge of inspiring a thousand minds,</p>
                <p>to accomplish what your one mind, can only barely conceive of today.</p>
