                    <p>Human Beings emerged, out of infinitely increasing complexity,</p>

                    <p>In a word, we are here because the Universe mixed it self for so long</p>
                    <p>that the failure for life to occur became inconceivable.</p>

                    <p>And, we want to believe life emerged, on Earth,</p>

                    <p>And we want to believe that Earth was the first to have life,</p>

                    <p>We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,</p>

                    <p>The convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,</p>

                    <p>Without that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,</p>

                    <p>By not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,</p>
                    <p>there grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.</p>

                    <p>They add to get more, they take to be more,</p>

                    <p>It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,</p>

                    <p>It actually isn&apos;t OK to do things to simplify,</p>

                    <p>Complexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,</p>
                    <p>we cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,</p>
                    <p>and wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.</p>

                    <p>Wisdom is a product of Love,</p>
                    <p>not the Beating Heart, but the Human Capacity to Love the Universe, The World, and The Human Family.</p>

                    <p>Becoming a Great Being, becoming Wise and Enlightened,</p>
                    <p>is the actual definition of being an Adult.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Pretending to be an Adult, by acting mature,</p>
                    <p>is to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.</p>

                    <p>Throwing away your Sweetens, and Foolishness, and Innocence, and all the Smiles that happen for no reason.</p>
                    <p>That&apos;s not growing up, that&apos;s the worst thing you can do to your self, and is probably very unhealthy.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>To become an Adult,</p>
                    <p>is to become a Philosopher.</p>

                    <p>If Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,</p>

                    <p>The greatest of superheroes, would encourage us to build things,</p>

                    <p>to begin moving towards becoming Great Wise Beings,</p>
                    <p>towards growing up by means of searching for wisdom,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Same things may have many different names,
and different things can be called by the same name.
Add liars, manipulators, pretenders,
the vengeful, greedy, and blind.
Add language barriers, national borders,
fake education, indoctrination, censorship,
misinformation, nationalism.
Add manipulation, disagreement, conflict, madness,
hate, apathy, desperation and stress.
Add weapons manufacturing,
and mutually assured destruction.
And there is no more common language left,
for exchange of important ideas.
Maybe there never was,
a common language.
Certainly, we must ensure,
that we do share a language.
Let us set the context, then,
we are an important chain-link,
in an endless progression of Human Generations.
You, are One of One Hundred Billion Human Beings,
to have ever lived.
Billions more will follow,
across millions of years ahead.
We are going to be here for so long,
that Evolution and Science will alter our very appearance.
Our actions will be Judged in the Courtroom of Time,
presided over by all the future generation.
Some, far in the future, may consider out modern times,
hardly distinguishable from Dark Ages.
We don&apos;t get old,
we grow wiser.
Many Great Beings repeat that,
&quot;Old age is a privileged denied to many&quot;.
And eventually,
we will take to the stars.
We are to live Happy, Authentic,
Fulfilling and Meaningful Lives.
There is no time for Lies or Babble,
but there is plenty of time for pursuits of excellence.
And time never stands still,
so much so that there is no such thing as business as usual.
The usual does not last long enough,
to become the norm.
We are to lead the way,
to rise to the challenges ahead.
And to move with such Magnificent Grace,
as to transcend the limits we didn&apos;t even notice we had.
Education and Culture,
is the only things that sets us apart,
from the beings of the Dark Ages.
We progressed out of those times,
by ever pushing forward and above.
By becoming more abstract thinkers,
and by using abstract thinking,
to solve problems,
by subtle analogy to other solutions.
The internet, is the first great step,
towards a Better World.
A world connected with devices,
capable of helping us communicate,
without a single bit of misunderstanding or distrust.
This clear communication interface of the future,
is but a simple engineering problem.
Perhaps, it is a symbolic user interface language,
perhaps a Virtual World,
perhaps a simulated City Government that grows to become the Planetary Government.
But certainly, it is near,
and it will not be stopped,
and it will be a source of truth,
and it will transcend borders,
and it will beam from the sky.
And there will be no room for lies,
no room for manipulations,
nothing to gain by weapons manufacturing,
nothing to gain by hoping to carve humanity with borders,
or deny basic rights.
It will slowly sneak up on those,
who would wish to stop it.
It will sneak up on them by means,
of their very own ignorance and arrogance.
In the world of the future,
we exist as One Humanity.
There is no poverty,
there is no hunger.
And our greatest aim,
is Great Health, Impossible Wisdom,
and simple Cheerfulness and Happiness and Joy.
Captains Log, Supplemental, September 13, 2820
There is a huge unmentionable Universal Debt,
that originally, by mistake, landed on a single credit card,
of an unsuspecting young lady in Belgium
- nobody knows why, including myself!
She was just born the year it happened,
so she didn&apos;t even need a card.
Someone just noticed that all debt was being charged to her account,
never said anything, and somehow, it stayed that way, for many hundreds of years afterwards.
Once she became legally obliged to do something about her debt circa 2040,
it was just cheaper to ignore the account, than to print the bill,
not to mention the bills needed to pay it off.
Notably some decades later,
arguably the most valuable human being on Earth,
would sweetly joke that she was the Most Worthless One.
She&apos;s been paying for everyone&apos;s food,
including all the pizzas economists eat,
so no one dared to say a thing for ages.
Hundreds of years later,
the new generations just assumed,
money was invented to be helpful (certainly not hurtful),
and that Little Chlo&#xE9; was the original inventor.
We are one family, after all,
there is no need to go hungry - never was.
It is of some note, that the most expensive thing she paid for,
was the first Star Ship, the Asteroid class Ark that begun colonizing the Milky Way.
That age was marked by our crossing from Homo Sapiens, to Homo Deus,
and the Star Ship was named, after none other than our little Chlo&#xE9;.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">A system of institutions is like a collection of computer programs,
where each program relies on the other for valid information.
Cities are powered by institutions, and when institutions go bad,
the entire city suffers; similar to how a computer will begin misbehaving.
The central processing unit of an institution, is people working within its walls,
it is a human powered computer, unlike machines, human based computers can self-repair.
A small and common example of a Human Powered computer is the modern Trash Truck,
the one that only has the driver operating that huge claw.
Another example is an unmanned aircraft,
whose operator is somewhere on the ground.
And a more down to the ground example is the modern supermarket Self-Checkout,
whenever the customer has a problem, the computer system will actually dispatch a human being for help.
Finally, the first known instance of a Human Powered Machine is the Turk,
it was a 1770 Chess Playing machine hoax, that had the operator hiding inside.
Here I bring attention to Failure, where the Education System,
is no longer operating, and thus causing stress, depression, poverty and desperation.
On the scale of a city when Education fails, it will cause an increase in crime,
and a city will begin filling its jails with those who were pushed to a breaking point out of desperation.
When institutions of a system such as a city begin failing,
all institutions are negatively affected.
Therefore it is in the best interest of all institutions to ensure integrity across the city,
and when that equilibrium can no longer be reached others, need to be artificially powered down.
For example we can&apos;t fail students and then start sending them to jail,
we have to scale the Justice System in proportion to how well the schools an other related systems are operating.
And wait for all to reach a healthy equilibrium.
We cannot perform business as usual, on one end, when the other is broken,
that can only further destabilize the system and cause even more damage.
The institutions of a city must not isolate themselves from reality,
the reason why we are not replacing Human Powered Institutions with Mere Machines, is Heart.
The Heart,
and Love for the citizen.
For a city to be called a city, and not a heartless machine for forcing human beings into desperation,
the poor, uneducated, ill, and homeless, must come first, they must be granted safe homes, medical care, and welfare.
A city must be judged by what happens to the least fortunate,
way out on the borders that most tend to look away from.
Then; we must practice Crime Prevention by means of a Functional Real Education Systems,
that use the city&apos;s funds to help its students out of poverty by helping them to operate small businesses,
as a way of investing into its own not so distant future.
In a city without of balance,
&quot;the best we can&quot; may often become &quot;the worst we&apos;ve had.&quot;
We must practice preferential treatment for the disadvantaged,
for the uneducated, for those in dire need, and for the ill.
Let us call this:
Love Above Law,
The Future, and Future Generation demand,
that the Justice System learns to see,
because it is not meant to be a blind machine.
It was never about business as usual,
because time, never, stood still.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We must repair schools,
and finally put an end to ideas like listen and repeat and short term memorization.
The first and foremost is the elimination of grades,
which also means elimination of standardized testing.
There cannot be such a thing as a Standard Human,
with a standard mind, it is very foolish to think that.
The second is the division of subjects,
and that is no different than browsing the World Encyclopedia.
Eventually, people who arrive at Gene Editing,
will choose their own path through Biology.
Eventually, those who take to building Software,
will create a path through languages and concepts that fit them best.
Same for every other subject...
Mathematics can be studied from an enormous number of starting points,
from Color Theories, and Music and Sound Processing,
to 3D Printing, Game and Game Engine Design, Astrobiology, Cryptanalysis and Combinatorial Genomics,
it is not presented as an aim, but rather a small stepping stone in a familiar context, and thus much more easily mastered.
Once a student displays a long term curiosity for a subject,
they will choose to be tested and choose to follow industry standards,
they will also choose an evolving test program to which they themselves may contribute.
As a whole, that creates their own Study Curriculum,
Curriculum Vitae, Resume and Job Posting.
The student moves at their own pace,
leaving an open trail that can be reviewed by prospective employers,
teachers, fellow researchers, and employers willing to pay for their study.
Certain paths can carry a Bounty, or Monetary Tips, Recurring Monetary Encouragement,
and above all creates a point into which the Government, City or Community, can invest.
This is an Open School where anybody can come,
where anybody can begin excelling at a subject that they are interested in.
Many may start with traditional subjects like Mathematics,
but here mathematics is presented with connecting points to various industries, and scholarships.
The software program behind this system will be kept purposefully simple and open,
it is after-all very similar to World Encyclopedia with a Blockchain for purposes of Scholarships and Path Funding.
The software will discourage disconnected clusters in hopes of bringing Humanity together to a single Truth we can all agree on,
as this an important requirement for dealing with Elimination of Poverty, Improvement of Education, Repair of Climate, and Prevention of Mass Incarceration.
Let us hope that this school will quickly become a Point of Cultural Convergence on Wisdom and Good Ideas,
a place for sharing Study Paths, Preservation of Knowledge, and a Fine Exit from Poverty by Means of Self Education and Pursuit of Excellence.
The Nations that Choose to Invest in This School to Help with Scholarship Programs,
will be investing in nothing less than the very Future of Human Kind.
One Family,
United In Wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Real education is a Great Empowering Adventure,
that begins, with what is interesting to us.
It&apos;s how Human Beings progress forward,
it&apos;s how Socrates, DaVinci, Bruno, Newton, became known.
They followed a path as dictated by their mind,
and that dictation occurs, once precise layer after another.
You can become a genius within 10 years,
but this is not a race, it is best to take 30 years.
Thirty is perfect.
Don&apos;t worry, the schools are broken,
they are exactly as worthless as you think they are.
Grades are an insult to your mind,
and teachers will spew all kinds of nonsense but they just want to get paid.
Be warned, my Friend,
the classroom is the worst thing that can happen to a curious mind,
it will slice everything into boring irrelevant disconnected facts,
and force you into performing memory tricks with things that you will never want to remember.
Resist, but don&apos;t drop out,
just go to the library.
Eventually, you&apos;ll end at at the deans office,
just tell them the truth, you fell in love with Learning.
The Dean will tag you as a genius,
but you can&apos;t allow this to happen.
You are not gifted, you are not a genius - we are all geniuses.
All the other kids you left behind,
they need you to tell them that school is not teaching.
It is only making you role-play with memorization tricks,
it is actually preventing everyone from learning.
This is not intentional,
there is no government conspiracy.
Only mediocrity, people who are just trying to fake it until they make it.
I am sorry.
But if you just keep to the library,
keep making your way through all the lovable books.
And above all, watch over the others,
keep an eye on the ones who are cracking.
They need your help,
they need a way out.
They don&apos;t need hand holding,
they just need a way out.
That way is: Start-ups, building a little business,
building on their own ideas, in their own universe,
tell them to look up Y-Combinator and find something like it.
This way, if they fail, they will have an opportunity to come back up,
by saying &quot;The world has failed me, but I will not fail myself, I will not let them crush me.&quot;
Help the others to books, the weird kids, well the really weird kids that actually like math,
they will love Brian Greene, they may not necessarily read the whole book,
or even enjoy Quantum Physics, they just need to know that they can understand it.
Most of the kids will needed Audio Books,
we can&apos;t really read as well as the Author,
an in any way there is five ways to voice a paragraph, leave it to the author.
And then Documentaries, Climate, Education, Philosophy,
start with Astra Taylor maybe.
Everyone has their own path, each student has a unique beginning,
which is marked by natural curiosity, comfort, and a sense of progression.
Moreover, once they take that first step and taste their first lesson,
the second lesson will come much easier, because in their mind,
it is connected, it is connected by the path they are on.
In school when when we switch from Language to Math, Music, and Biology,
there is no path, there is no continuity, there can only be temporary memorization,
and permanent forgetting.
There is no building one layer after another towards Wisdom and Enlightenment,
there is just graduation and desperation that leads to a shitty job.
Such a blind, dead end, death march toward the end of youth, cheerfulness, and dreams,
will induce depression, self medication, acting out, fighting, and sometimes addiction or worse.
Add grades, that many stupid teachers passionately care about,
to the point of not just thinking that students are stupid,
but actually convincing many of the students,
that the pointless grade is a measure of of their intelligence.
Sit them in rows to listen to incomprehensible curricula,
that can only be blindly memorized, by a half crazed madman.
Sprinkle in a bunch of bullies,
with a mix of not-my-problem teachers that can only proclaim &quot;Life isn&apos;t fair for us all.&quot;
And, then when they come home, add parents that punish them for no longer having any respect left for them.
It is not just schools that were created to try to help you,
there is a backup,
countless writers writing specifically to you the younger generation, you.
Use the backup,
help the others.
Make sure nobody drops out,
make sure they finish listening to their Audio Books.

                  <span class="text-muted">I had a strange dream, Dear Reader, and at first I thought it was too odd to share,
but now I am thinking, maybe someone you will care.
I dreamt that schools were totally, completely fake,
and that the future of the whole world was at stake.
They became fake because they never could teach,
no teacher has ever had that kind of reach.
Eventually it just became all make believe,
and school became a real thief.
It stole Knowledge from you,
it did it to get teachers paid through.
Most assumed, you wouldn&apos;t notice as it kept all blind,
but that early Knowledge was important for the shaping the mind.
There was no one in charge, so no whistle was blown,
it was fake it until you make it, each on their own.
They wrote tests to keep scores within range,
to stay below all radars, and to resist any improvement or change.
Expensive text books, purely artificial grades,
cheap college and expensive university to encourage transfers and trades.
The students who did well,
they had to keep quiet to pass, and anyway, there was no one to tell.
They had to work thrice as hard working with tutors and in groups,
jumping stupid hoops, making pointless and crazy loops.
And they knew that their success made schools look real and true,
but they had no choice, they had to, graduate and move on through.
Then you got up and said &quot;I am through!,
&quot;how do we fix this - what do we do?&quot;
That&apos;s when I woke up, and thought - &quot;Maybe I should answer this.&quot;,
and the first thought that came to my mind was &quot;Knowledge is Bliss&quot;
So I said out loud: &quot;Real Education must be your own creation!&quot;,
after all, is not too hard to find moving inspiration so that you can build your own education.
And why do we need a small High School lecture,
perhaps it is time to change that architecture.
We should listen to a Famous Audio Books or the University Edition,
perhaps that should become the standard position.
Standardized testing should not lead the way,
it is just a test to see if we learning OK.
It seem to me that time has come for change,
perhaps this is why schools feel so strange.
So, I challenge you, my Dear Reader,
lead the change you hope to see, become the leader!</span>
