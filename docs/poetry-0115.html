          <p>All those High and Mighty claims of<br>
            &quot;I am stronger&quot;, &quot;I can run longer&quot;, &quot;You can&apos;t do what I do&quot;, are bunk.</p>
          <p>But they also beautifully underline the importance of Endurance,<br>
            nothing is more important for an Athlete than Proper Endurance.</p>
          <p>Without a solid measure endurance,<br>
            we probably can&apos;t push out body into adaptation.</p>
          <p>In a way, will run out of the ability to go forward,<br>
            just before our body notices it needs to make some changes.</p>
          <p>Endurance may just be the very core of any and all Athletic pursuits,<br>
            including Bodybuilding, Gymnastics, and even Dancing.</p>
          <p>It is easiest to see that in Long Distance running,<br>
            in order to finish the race, we have to gradually increase our distance.</p>
          <p>It is very unhealthy to try to run an ultra-marathon,<br>
            without having first worked on our endurance.</p>
          <p>In bodybuilding lifting something 30 times may entertain a muscle,<br>
            but it is unlikely to influence it to develop to be better.</p>
          <p>Slowly gaining endurance to lift, three hundred times, three thousand times, and fifteen thousand times...<br>
            Will reliably encourage your body to adapt.</p>
          <p>Gradually increasing endurance, and eating a healthy and balanced diet,<br>
            will slowly send a signal to your body, that it must adapt.</p>
          <p>Endurance is the secret,<br>
            and <strong>gradually</strong> is the method of increasing it.</p>
