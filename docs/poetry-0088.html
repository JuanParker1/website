                  <span class="text-muted">No one person can save the world,
we have to take turns because of how exhausting that is.
No one person can speak to the whole world,
the world is too complex and our voice and message will become too scattered.
We just need to keep speaking until the message of leaving bad ideas behind becomes less and less blurry.
Our problem is not so dissimilar
from the problem of a victim of a cult.
Our problem works on the same principle,
limited knowledge, limits our awareness,
limited awareness constricts us to a subset of reality.
A fine example of constricted reality,
are dark or medieval ages.
Five hundred years ago Human Beings were just as intelligent as we are,
they simply knew less, were aware of less.
The culture and popular beliefs were rooted, in less.
Another example is raising a child,
with the genetics of someone from 10,000 years ago; today.
Growing up today would make them, just an average person,
they would not wish to take a bite out of a Woolly Mammoth,
or hope to own a Giant Ground Sloth, not anymore than we do.
They&apos;d appreciate the iPhone, in form of the model they appreciate the most,
and had they been made aware that they are of the Ice Age,
they&apos;d sweetly and jokingly name their kitty cat, Scrat.
Our knowledge and the culture we grow up in, is extremely influential,
it decides how we develop, who we become, and what we recognize as reality.
A child born a couple of hundred years for now,
will struggle to understand our ignorance towards climate change.
In the schools of tomorrow, they will learn that we were victims,
of broken educational systems, and cultures that didn&apos;t encourage pursuit of Wisdom.
To put it simply, some things sneak into us based on the level of our knowledge,
and the height of development of the culture we are born into.
So are we really?
Geniuses.
This is very important, it is a very important single word answer,
to a very important question, that has great impact on the future of humanity.
We are Geniuses.
You know that man that is always wearing old clothes,
and kind of works in a corner, and acts a little odd.
He is also a genius.
He is dying from loneliness, his mind is warped from ages of overwork,
he can&apos;t really connect with people anymore because he has been feeling like an outsider for too many years,
he found comfort in his corner, where he is safe and where his life is simple.
But, should a chain of events push him,
he will shed the patina of isolation, he will force himself to inherit modern culture and lifetimes from books,
and genius will return, it will be fresh, raw, reignited, he may for a moment become the wisest being on earth.
That&apos;s what genius is,
a combination of unbreakability, and intellectual infinity.
In more general terms,
We are a very odd Form of Life compared to all the other animals on Earth,
we are self aware, and we are able to evaluate, and adjust, we are self enabling.
Ayn wrote,
&quot;If a drought strikes them, animals perish - man builds irrigation canals;
if a flood strikes them, animals perish - man builds dams;
if a carnivorous pack attacks them, animals perish - man writes the Constitution of the United States.&quot;
We are struck by a culture that does not fully represent reality,
but we will not jump from the cliff, we will not merely age - business as usual.
We will learn, we will teach ourselves to become genius,
the easy-peasy way, by going on long adventures with a bunch of wise non-fiction books.
When our planet comes under attack, it will not perish,
for it holds a species of animal that can perceive it self, alter, and rise to heights unseen.
All it takes,
is for us to notice, that something is wrong.
Perhaps, taking it easy, would be OK,
if you were not capable, of becoming a Great Being.
if you were not a Genius, and a Powerful Thinker.
If you were unable to rise, to Inspire Generations,
to save the Planet for all the Children yet to be born,
and to repair schools so that they help humanity progress.
But ultimately taking it easy, can&apos;t be OK,
because that would disappoint the one person that truly does have all the authority over you,
that you really do not want to disappoint, in any way.
Your Elder Self...
Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,
if you fail to quickly shed all the stupid things sneaked into you by mis-education and questionable culture.
Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,
if you fail to learn to unfold your wings as a genius, and an intellectual.
Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,
if you fail to rise out of loneliness and isolation.
Your elder self, will be seriously pissed off,
if you mess this up.
Your elder self will know exactly who you could have become,
and where you made the wrong decisions that prevented you from becoming the person that they wish to be.
My Friends,
I wish there was more I could to to help you believe that you are each a genius.
But I can only give you the books.
I can&apos;t put the ear-buds in your ears and press play,
because to hear the books you have to slow down in life,
you have to begin questioning the things that were driving you,
and you have to become ready to listen,
and by that time you can press play on your own.
A genius is not an intellectual anomaly,
even Savants spend years mastering their tricks.
We are all capable of gaining Powerful Intelligence,
and we don&apos;t need schools for that,
just a mountain of down to earth books made heavy with lifetimes of wisdom.
You don&apos;t need to memorize Mathematical Formulas,
and the last place you want to learn about Biology, is Biology.
What you need is stories that teach you about the reasons behind the invention of mathematics,
and and an adventure where you re-invent mathematics from scratch, with the fantastic and magical ability to look some stuff up along the way.
You don&apos;t need to learn about the powerhouse of the cell,
you need to begin with Stromatolites, Panspermia, Evolution and Astrobiology.
Mitochondria used to be a separate organism, what an adventure to follow, what an honor to make new discoveries on that path.
My Friends,
You must begin your education by pushing everything that interferes with your Natural Genius away,
even if it is the city you live in, or school you are forced to go to.
And you must begin your life, knowing that you are a Powerful Genius,
in dire need for more books and audio books that will fuel your Wisdom.
As I write this,
there are only 3,900 tigers left.
Please, believe in your genius, and grow, my friend,
it is not just the tigers that need help,
the task at hand if far greater.
With ten million people in cages around the word,
we have to help children and students of today,
out of poverty, and towards real education,
so that they may have a chance at a fair start in life.</span>

learning slowly in many stages.
I begun in 1999,
and I am still learning new things about design.
All the programming languages changed many times,
but knowing the whole history is very useful at times.
I&apos;ve learned a lot from the command line,
to art, colors, design, and how to reach the finish line.
I am surprised how long it all took,
but with all I know I am sure I could write a whole book.
I still have to learn a bunch of stuff,
but it is not going to be very tough.
I mostly have to get all the colors, and glows to dance and blend,
I kind of left all the fun stuff for the very end.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Let the deans nod to the graduates that drink most coffee,
sitting with presidents and dignitaries,
let them smile that each passed their trial.
But you, Dear Mother, you take your child to the Library,
make it their Castle, make it their Home,
make it their Temple of Knowledge.
&quot;My Mother used to bring me here almost every day,
this is my Temple of Knowledge, this is my Forever Home.&quot;
Teach that non-fiction, especially Memoirs,
are the only safe way to grow up.
Keep them on a path to understanding of the simplest things first,
and the most important things second so that they may build an easy on-ramp for themselves.
Remind them, that all young mistakes have already been made countless times,
that all the lessons, answers, and hopes of prevention,
are to be found in sacred stories of Triumph and Disaster.
That there is little in blind following.
And that there is Everything in pursuit of Wisdom,
to join with the Greater Family of the Great Human Beings,
that came before us and are sure to follow.
That school is just a Dream,
of a Simpler Universe,
a melody sweetly played,
but not in tune.
That our mind at its most responsible,
is the Sole Institution that we require,
for Pursuits of Excellence and Higher Learning.
So as long as we love ourselves,
as long as we are compassionate to ourselves,
we can comprehend inside out, many times the knowledge,
of those who are taught, outside in.
Let the Temple of Knowledge,
shine its beacon and sound the bell,
each time the little ones need answers,
and each time they are ready to commit their own wisdom to History.
World Peace requires,
that each child today,
becomes a Great Being,
in the Greater Tomorrow.
World Peace has little to do with the unobtainable ceasefire today,
and has everything to do, with letting children grow up under blue skies,
without drone strikes, deafening echoes of explosions, bullet riddled walls, and detention camps.
May the Greatness of Your Vision, and Unbreakability of your Heart and Mind,
help the Unstoppable Children of today, become the Great Beings the Future Needs.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We have to remind each other,
that change requires,
that you and I grow.
That we grow in strength,
that we grow in experience.
that we grow in knowledge.
That we grow in Wisdom,
that we grow in Foresight.
That we grow all the way up.
We can&apos;t afford expensive Universities,
we don&apos;t even have the time.
We don&apos;t really want to graduate from Brown,
or Harvard, or Yale.
What we really want, is to spend a semester at each,
and for our hard earned wisdom to count as much as their Curriculum and GPA.
It would be nice to give a graduation speech,
though, it wouldn&apos;t last for very long,
everyone is so busy on that day.
And what a drop in the ocean,
a few years will seem come our Golden Age of Wisdom.
We have to be heard, BEYOND, a mere graduation speech,
and we have to learn FAR BEYOND anything a class can teach us.
We can&apos;t afford to be students, not for a year, not for a day,
because we are born at a gallop, and onward; to become an unstoppable force of Nature,
AND CHANGE, Meaningful Change.
That means, your little High School poetry book,
makes it into the back pocket of Every High School Troublemaker and Dropout.
And they will rely on your Down To Earth Greatness, and Your Unlimited, Unconfined, Hard Earned Wisdom,
to get through their nights, and to cross to the hills,
and to begin their Unlimited Journey to Their Mountain Tops.
There isn&apos;t time for classroom experience,
there is only time for Wisdom, Love and a Meaningful Contributions.
Every new intellectual,
each new dreamer, poet, writer or orator hoping to help the world grow,
needs a far greater audience, and a greater runway for a greater wisdom,
than any University can provide.
The changes cannot come from the Policy Makers, or Impressive Dignitaries, or Inspired Professors,
they can only come form deep within each and every Human Being alive today, and all those that are yet to come,
standing - on their own - in relentless pursuit of Excellence and Wisdom, not Grades, or Prestige.
We don&apos;t need more laws, more prisons, talking heads, and deans,
we need to take to the audio books, video lectures, the internet,
and learn at a speed far greater than any curriculum can offer.
Begin recording your first audio book,
listen to what you know,
and where you need to know more.
Pull yourself up by your own shoelaces,
let Unrestrained Education take over.
Wisdom graded by the lives you touch,
by the disasters you avert,
by the wisdom you share.
Let us set fairy tales aside,
and let us accept responsibility for our own education.
And encouraging all we meet to do the same,
there can not be a greater Brand Name,
than a Wise Humanity.
The world needs our help,
it is a call far beyond what Universities can point us towards to.
The world needs all... the Humans to Graduate.
From the upcoming politicians with their over-inflated campaigns,
and research that relies on low education and short foresight of the voter.
To those of us, who didn&apos;t want to go to MIT, or Harvard,
because we felt it only hold us back, if not downright break our heart.
Universities are little promises meant for a smaller and happier world,
the world of today is far too big to be moved by mere graduates,
even if it was all the universities trying all at once.
Every Human Being requires an Outstanding Education,
one that empowers them to stand up against all the wrong in the world today.
With the light of Intellectual Inheritance worthy of The Noblest Independent Human,
and the light they themselves bring to the world come their Golden Age of Wisdom.
My Dear Reader,
may you learn, and piece together so much wisdom,
as to ignite a light so powerful that each and every child in the word,
from across all political borders and language barriers will visit you and listen,
and grow in wisdom with your lesson and enlightenment.
Let us part part with the idea of an exclusive University and brand name education (whatever that is),
and take to every book worthy of each of us,
and learn more, and faster,
and greater lessons than can be taught outside in.
Because today&apos;s challenges are greater than the solutions that anyone in particular can bring,
the solution is in all of us, reaching and mastering knowledge and wisdom one by one.
The Protection of The Younger Generations from War, Poverty and Greed,
is the first and foremost, and must come as a result of a Wiser Humanity.
World Peace, and Human Rights,
are close second.
The Human Mind and Life is Too Sacred,
for little fairy tales of exclusive education.
Do not wait to be taught,
learn, and learn to no end in sight,
and when you know enough, share; and teach.
And may each Human Being,
grow to know that Wisdom, Growing All The Way Up, Greatness,
is neither optional, nor meant for the lucky few.
Let us accept the responsibility for Outstanding Self Education,
because for the world to grow; it is either all of us, or none.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Where, sometimes, we all belong,
and where life is very, very, very, very, long.
As it winds along the well worn paths like a little song,
and where there is always a right, that can fix a wrong.
And we are hardly ever alone, so as long as we stand strong,
and you can achieve anything so as long as your effort is lifelong.
Many others traveled all these sandy roads,
many handled much more weight and greater workloads.
But it really all revolves about how much you learn, love, and know,
that&apos;s what helps you get unstuck from that rainy office window.
We don&apos;t have to ride every crazy rodeo,
live beneath an angry grumbling volcano.
Run as if chased by herds of stampeding buffalo,
and like every corner hides a foe.
Beautifully... it is best to live life slow,
in tune with crickets, starry nights, frogs and rain, sunshine, and snow.
Live so slow as to have time to learn, think, and write,
to share with others all that you found to be lovely and bright.
And not knowing what to write about, is the best,
because that means Nordhouse is calling you, to a little quest.
And when you return, you will have to find a warm and cozy nook,
grab a mug of chocolate and let your poems flow into your litte book.
Yup, you may need to pack a back pack, and give it a go,
remember, life is longest, when you live it slow.</span>
