                  <span class="text-muted">Just like we are vulnerable,
to listening to authority without question.
Just like we are blind to indoctrination,
unable to see fast enough that reality had been warped.
We also have a problem of integration with Knowledge and Wisdom,
if our days are too busy, stressful, too short, we won&apos;t be able to learn.
Ensuring that we live at a proper pace,
is part of taking care of our Mental and Intellectual Hygiene.
Our Mental Health is important,
we should never forget to take care of our minds.
The pace you live at can prevent you from learning,
so you have to live in balance, and in balance with time.
How do you know if you are out of balance?
- that is actually a very easy question to answer.
When you feel, like you need to &quot;go somewhere&quot; to think,
it means you are out of balance, and you need to re-prioritize matters in your life.
Thinking is critical to our well being,
not being able to think, is a sign of trouble.
Experiencing difficulty with thinking and having ideas,
means that we have to find a way to adjust our lifestyle.
Our minds are too powerful to try to shut them off,
we are all geniuses, extremely powerful thinkers, with infinite imaginations.
Past the point when we adjust to be able to enjoy storytelling,
we have to choose books that feed our soul, that make us laugh and wonder.
Our minds need storytelling for enriching our imagination,
a good book is always about some story being told.
Finally, don&apos;t let yourself be tricked by the appearance of books,
or the simplicity and convenience of Audio Books.
A paper book is a very desperate attempt and hope,
to share a deeply personal treasure.
A novel is often times a hidden way to say something,
something that authors don&apos;t want to take personal responsibility for.
If it is on paper,
it is on paper because there was nothing else to put it on.
What other way to transfer Thought Treasures is there,
paper is an improvement over story tellers that would memorize myths and recite them.
I am sure there used to be professional readers,
that would come to a wealthy persons house and beautifully recite a book.
But once we were able to record a book,
an Audio Book became even better than a paper book.
An Audio Book can transfer more emotion,
and a book that is well read by the author, is a treasure, in deed.
An Audio Book will transfer more wisdom than the paper version,
and do not forget about Documentaries, Videos, Lectures and Speeches.
The modern age has been able to greatly enrich the transfer of wisdom,
I beg you to inherit it all, and I hope you do.
The greatest and most enriching Science, Philosophy, Adventure and Storytelling Books,
have not been created to make money or for fame.
The greatest works,
are works created out of Love for Future Generations.
Personal Note,
Due to the way copyright laws work there are many beautiful books in the Public Domain,
if you were to challenge yourself to voice certain books in the most beautiful of ways,
I am sure people from all around the world would love you for it.
Some books that that come to mind are Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, The Art of War by Sun Tzu and
of course Hagakure by Yamamoto Tsunetomo.
Also, keep in mind what a wonderful treasure recordings you made in your youth become as time flows,
what great inheritance to the children of the future to hear their Grand-grand-grand-grand Grandma,
reading Jack London, Leo Tolstoy, Herman Melville, H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, Mary Shelley, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
...And uhh... you know, (and this is just between you and me),
you could uhh... spice up the slower, dryer parts of said books.
You know, mistakes happen, you could for example mix up Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein
with H. G. Wells&apos; Time Machine, and add a sprinkle or two of The Whale by Herman Melville,
and tie it all together with some sweet romantic story from your own wonderful life.
I assure you with all my heart,
it will only make your art of reading,
that much more fascinating.

                  <span class="text-muted">Elementary Schools are still a Dream,
perhaps the most beautiful Achievement of Human Kind.
Before mandatory education people didn&apos;t think poor kids could learn,
people didn&apos;t want poor kids to learn.
But we did it,
we did it, it worked.
It will always work,
we learn to write, to read, numbers.
And multiplication, here is when teachers make the mistake of memorization,
where they look down on the ability to create a multiplication table,
a delayed addition lookup table.
Here, a new kind of memorization begins,
the kind that destroy our climate, our health, our very humanity.
The moment, the teacher, says, MEMORIZE,
they are now working on getting paid.
This is where school breaks down,
where it all falls apart.
In the worst way, now, a lookup table, is a shameful cheat-sheet, it becomes a D+ or a 2+ and it stains,
and it shows up in College papers, all the papers, all the worthless papers.
And this would be fine, except it stains our minds as well,
because deep down we believe even in the worst teachers.
And that belief, in that memorization grade charade,
digs into us, and books start feeling optional, and math useless.
Children grow up without faith in Education and Knowledge,
they don&apos;t believe in the Power of Wisdom, and Noble Teachers and Guardians.
They are still geniuses, powerfully smart, but the betterment of Humanity,
is not the aim, the aim is to prove that they can do whatever it is.
And we lose a child, a student, and gain something else.
The teachers, sold the world,
for a small paycheck.
We can fix this.
First of all, your grades were nonsense,
all the things you couldn&apos;t memorize well enough were not a judgment of your intelligence,
it was a judgment of how well you perform circus tricks, how deep your faith in teachers.
You were a Genius,
we all are, there is no anomaly that grans us magical brains,
it is a function of NOT MEMORIZING, and looking at how the formulas were invented.
You master match by studying its history,
not by memorizing formulas.
Imagine what would happen to Newton,
if he only memorized formulas.
Imagine reading a foreign storybook that way,
just memorizing pronunciation of word after word without learning the language first.
The language for Mathematics is not numbers,
it is love of Universe, of Complexity, search for answers,
gaining insight into the working of the universe, by subtle analogy to the simplified mechanics behind mathematics.
It is a lovely, but primitive language that can be brought to life with computers,
programming, game development, even design.
Past a certain point, people didn&apos;t know how to teach,
so they used memorization, out of desperation.
Memorization temporarily acts like learning, knowing,
the effects wear off in days, where knowledge is the foundation of the heights we reach.
Grades are fake,
you go tricked,
sold for a paycheck.
Most of the sciences are learned by studying their history,
there is no memorization, there is no memorization, there is no memorization.
Just beautiful little notes, journals, lookup tables,
including the multiplication table, but also all the tables you invent.
We are all geniuses,
some take the easy road, and lie, and trick, and manipulate, and pretend, and try to fake it until they make it.
Others,
try to make money, keep bringing a paycheck home, keep lying, get the funding, lower the test standards, process the kids so that all get paid.
We are vulnerable this way,
we tend to believe people in authority.
Even the ones that reject it,
also reject the idea that they are smart.
A mind that rejects memorization in favor of integrity, or authenticity,
shows beauty, shows a love of life.
Genius is just the beginning,
past the Sweet Elementary that I know we all love, we only have books.
There is a lot of Audio Books, a Lot of Mighty Lectures,
but you have to reach out for that.
To do that,
you can&apos;t just hear me saying it;
You have to believe that You were a Genius All Along,
it was just some desperate pretenders along the way trying to put food on their table that tricked you.
I know how to help you regain Faith in Education,
I want you to begin at Concord, Massachusetts, Walden Pond.
I want you, I command you to go see Henry,
go now it matters not that it is not Spring.
You will go back to greet him many times,
go see Henry, at the Walden Pond.
Take a rock, from where you are at right now,
and add it to the pile that&apos;s already there.
Thoreau, in return will help you slow down,
and calm down, he will help you come to a speed that&apos;s necessary for audio books.
You are going to go to England soon,
you are headed for Westminster Abbey.
You are going to visit Sir Isaac.
he will help you understand that Knowledge comes from within.
Take a long time to listen,
understand that you are more than a genius,
you are a creator.
With the Insight granted by Sir Isaac Newton,
and the Peace and Calm bestowed upon you by Henry David Thoreau.
You will find your beginning anew,
you will return to the point where you got tricked into thinking that you are not a genius.
And finally,
let your journey begin at Springer Mountain in Georgia, or Mount Katahdin in Maine,
the others need help, they need to accept the responsibility for their own self education as well.
Please, take many years to section hike the Appalachian Trail,
here Mother Nature and The Kindness of Strangers, and Trail Magic will be your teacher.
Listen, Read, and Write.
Write to get to know yourself, write to figure out the best way to learn,
write to inspire a generation after a generation to make it to their rightful place, as Genius and Creator.
Together We Can Fix It All.

                  <span class="text-muted">Recordings of lectures and digital materials should be put into public domain.
Schools should not to charge money for recordings of lectures.
Education is meant to be free, for the Good of All Humanity.
An institution may charge money for a live lecture,
with the teacher or professor available to answer questions to those who pay.
But that is not how it should be done,
not in the modern age.
The lectures need to be free,
teachers should be available globally.
There are only so many questions related to the lecture,
it is to everyone&apos;s benefit; to answer all those questions,
and release, a new and updated video and audio recording.
Do not stand in the way of a student,
find a different way to make money, teacher!
An institution that puts a child in debt,
does so at the cost of losing prestige and relevance,
it tarnishes the prestige and hard work of its faculty and administration.
Teachers, Professors, Deans, Administrators,
there is no money to be made by standing in the way of knowledge.
There isn&apos;t a single student on this earth,
whose wisdom does not influence everyone else
By keeping lectures under lock and key, and debt,
you are contributing to the very problem you claim to be a solution for.
Please release recordings of your lectures into the public domain,
work on improving quality and content, and removing any and all remaining access barriers.
Let the children learn,
let them in.
This is the modern age now, the age of Collaborative Encyclopedias, Streamers, Audio Books, and Pocket Computers,
help The Children and Humanity Grow, upload, let everyone in.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">You have to break away,
and start doing the things you love, your way.
You only grow smarter, when you add thoughts together,
and create a greater whole that makes you better.
You have to find your beginning, right now,
find a way to stop listening to everyone, somehow.
Tomorrow never comes, by the way,
come, midnight and it&apos;s already today.
Don&apos;t let life pass you by,
open your eyes, let your imagination become your sky.
Up, is the direction you have to grow,
find what moves you, and follow that flow.
Follow the lessons that you love,
make your own path of education to fit you like a glove.
Lessons can only stick together,
when you love them, when they matter.
If you don&apos;t know where to start,
download audio books to ignite your passion and heart.
Whatever you do,
don&apos;t let school and grades trick you.
All minds are equally powerful,
but our imagination has to become beautiful.
The best way to expand imagination,
is by creating a path of your own exploration.
Think about the way you learned to walk,
what our minds needed to learn to talk.
Learn from non-fiction audio books first,
it is unrestricted knowledge to make you thirst.
Then read about business, and let your imagination soar,
because a diploma doesn&apos;t get you a job anymore.
You need to choose the books and adventures that you love,
the stuff that doesn&apos;t make sense is what you need to get rid of.
Discover the wisdom behind the things you love,
step by step climb higher and above.
We are each a natural born genius, extremely smart,
we each have more than enough to turn our life into beautiful art.</span>

You have to move an entire generation, or two,
and they need to be really touched so that they may follow you.
You have to speak out, to inspire,
send a Noble Message that everyone can hear and admire.
Fix schools, and end poverty, both at the same time,
this will help to prevent and stop most crime.
Reality is a fierce and powerful friend,
it is the only thing that will drive blindness to a permanent end.
Look decades into future, make your aims many, but small,
and baby step, by baby step go forward, to meet your goal.</span>
