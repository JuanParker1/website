        <p>Waiting for the sun to inch down,<br>
          before I go out in the town.</p>
        <p>My legs have become like two huge potatoes,<br>
          but that&apos;s life, that&apos;s how it goes.</p><br>
        <p>There are so many lovely people that notice me out there,<br>
          yesterday a cute couple, lady with fancy hair.</p>
        <p>A couple of days ago, a gent from the gym,<br>
          slowly walking and wondering &quot;Is that him?&quot;</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, that was me! I shaved my mustache,<br>
          and taught my self to dash.</p>
        <p>Sure I run at the speed of a sickly gastropod,<br>
          but after my gym-dancing, don&apos;t even feel odd.</p><br>
        <p>And before that, the ladies in the Jeep,<br>
          I didn&apos;t wave back, I am sorry, I was in the middle of a huge leap.</p>
        <p>And then the first person to notice me in my sluggish swim,<br>
          might have been the Trainer! from the gym.</p>
        <p>I was really tired in the middle of my early run,<br>
          muttering &quot;I can&apos;t believe I have to run the same distance, before I am done.&quot;</p>
        <p>And then I heard &quot;Hi! Andre!&quot; and I instantly regained my strength,<br>
          I could have run five times that length.</p><br>
        <p>Sure, I am still learning, running tests and trails,<br>
          but my aim is one hour, to do the whole five miles.</p>
        <p>And you know what, just after two weeks,<br>
          I run a lot faster; and I have rosy cheeks!</p>
