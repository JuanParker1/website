          <p>Not Until This, Not Until That<br>
            Don&apos;t let anybody push you around,</p>
          <p>If you allow negativity towards you for long enough,<br>
            it will make you very ill.</p>
          <p>Tolerance of negativity will push you to cross lines,<br>
            it will derail you the same way that lies derail liars.</p>
          <p>It is like the lines that addicts cross,<br>
            until there is no way to come back.</p><br>
          <p>Take a look into the mind of the person negative towards you,<br>
            do they even see you as a person?</p>
          <p>If their ultimate aim is not to rob you of yourself to turn you into a tool,<br>
            then are you not some disposable mean to their shortcuts.</p>
          <p>Nothing is found in servitude, it won&apos;t make you stronger,<br>
            it won&apos;t make you nobler, or enlightened, or worthy.</p>
          <p>Protect your mind, reject being pushed around,<br>
            stand up, rise, do not follow, no one has any control over you.</p><br>
          <p>You become Stronger when you rise,<br>
            when you put your feet down on the ground, and push up - to the mountains.</p>
          <p>You become Nobler when you break away,<br>
            when you let go of those ahead of you, and take your own path to the side.</p>
          <p>You become Wise and Enlightened when you stand your ground Memoirs in hand,<br>
            when you learn from the lessons on your own path, and by subtle analogy to other paths.</p>
          <p>You become Worthy, of Yourself, of Love, of Wisdom, of a house you can call Home,<br>
            when you grow protecting who you are, onward to becoming the best You.</p><br>
          <p>Do not be scared, because if you stay scared, nothing will change,<br>
            do not let sadness keep you in bed, go to the library first.</p>
          <p>Do not let the sick thick stickiness to keep you bound,<br>
            most of it is illusion, including the few pleasures you found.</p>
          <p>Do net let alligator tears, and hollow souls void of any content howl you back,<br>
            you are not part of that world, you never were.</p>
          <p>Do not go slowly wandering down their own paths, that&apos;s how <em>they</em> were created,<br>
            and you can still reject that agony and become free.</p><br>
          <p>Look to the best within you, your Beautiful Treasures,<br>
            your Innocence, your Sweetness, your Love, your Cuteness, your Generosity, your Might, your Endurance.</p>
          <p>Those are powerful treasures meant to help you become a Great Being,<br>
            treasures that they have forsaken in their own selves.</p>
          <p>Now they are trying to forsaken your own treasures, to fuhrer the dark path they dig,<br>
            do not let them take what is irreplaceable within you.</p>
          <p>You cannot aid them in any way, that can only feed their evil,<br>
            and take away from your Beautiful Treasures.</p><br>
          <p>Let the world see you, read at the Library, visit Museums and Art Galleries,<br>
            go see someone singing with their beautiful voice.</p>
          <p>Write in your journal, record on your phone, sharpen your pencil,<br>
            use tracing paper to learn how to draw.</p>
          <p>Step after step courageously walk down the isles to get your first air dry clay,<br>
            and sculpt, sculpt your world, and touch, and feeling, show the world.</p>
          <p>Do not hide, reject the bad, and shine among the crowds,<br>
            do not let your older-self cry that you were never seen.</p>
