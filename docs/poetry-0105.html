                  <span class="text-muted">We have a tendency to take things for granted,
and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.
It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.
The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.
Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.
The world has also become more interconnected,
those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.
Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,
all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.
There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,
the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.
All the fantasies and walls will fade, today&apos;s problem with borders and cults,
is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,
to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.
We are infinite in our minds,
just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.
Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,
something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.
It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,
and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.
This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,
this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.
And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,
the sciences call to everyone.
Personalized education doesn&apos;t really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,
as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.
Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,
and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.
We don&apos;t learn the way schools teach,
we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.
By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,
problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.
A more knowledgeable world,
is a more capable world.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each generation, including yours, Dear Reader,
is charged with figuring out, what is wrong.
Previous generations discovered many wrongs,
Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.
Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,
we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.
The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,
is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.
Liars everywhere, in the blindness caused by lack of education,
are easily out-competing generations of beings who dedicated their lives to the betterment of Human Kind.
Children are forced to memorize and pretend to learn to get good grades,
and hope to go to colleges and universities that hardly live up to their promises.
Their job search, and school loans,
the way they are treated from interview to retirement does not do them justice.
The younger generations are the Sacred Hope and Future of Human Hind,
but they are now exploited by old fat lice who cannot stop feeding even if their life depends on it.
The teachers in their haste to bring a little paycheck home have lost the respect for students,
professors now sell home-made textbooks as ineffective as their lectures, and universities.
The children can see all this,
they understand the minds of these failures.
They merely need to ask:
&quot;How would I have to think, and how low would I have to sink, to do as they do.&quot;
Humanity requires a real educational system to effectively pass knowledge between generations,
when we finally create it, we will see blind stupidity and all the evils it fuels, fade.
My friends, this is not a difficult project,
we come together to record video lectures, write and narrate books.
We pay,
for outstanding contributions and translations of these lectures.
That payment,
is the grade.
We create a massively multiplying and overlapping global educational system,
that has no structure, and countless redundant paths towards knowledge, excellence and wisdom.
Those paths,
are the diploma.
Companies that show compassion, worth and balance,
inspect these paths in search of talent.
Even so, students are encouraged to build multi-founder start-ups,
throughout the world and their lives.
This world school, is not an neat addition to this world,
this school: Becomes Our World.
It becomes our point of convergence on World Peace,
and the Library of Ideas worth keeping.
The fundamentally broken naysayers will come,
as the erosion of the good ideas and propagation of war, poverty, and all other bad ideas is their food.
But those who stand against Prosperity, Unity, Knowledge, Wisdom and World Peace,
are just an animated rotting corpse that needs to be left behind in the poverty and desperation they once exploited to their advantage.
For the sake of the future generations,
let us rise against evil and mediocrity.
May we abandon all that moves against the grain of reality,
and all that is fake, ineffective, and lacking positive, real, and permanent results.
Let us cradle the future generations in Knowledge, in Wisdom, and in Greatness,
and honor them and their challenges, with World Peace.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We can&apos;t have a standardized education,
because that would require a standardized life.
A life in which we are only passionate about
what we are told to be passionate about.
A life, where memorization,
does suffice.
My friends, the standardization of your existence,
is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.
A standardized existence is one
where your mind is taken from you.
Just like you recoil at the thought of a standardized breakfast,
the words standardized education should make you feel sick!
Even if you could learn by being taught like a little bird is fed,
how could you allow someone to pick the knowledge for your mind?
Allowing someone to insert standardized lessons into your mind is disgusting,
you are a unique and sacred being, born a genius and meant to be driven to wisdom and greatness.
You are meant to be the hope and dreams of all the past generations,
school, job, career, retirement and some promise of world travel is not how real life works.
The people in charge of creating early schools might not have had the opportunity
to create schools that are capable of inspiring the students to great heights.
Since, we have only updated that imperfect first attempt at mass education,
we lost the original dream of helping the world become Knowledgeable and Wise.
Today, teachers create cookie cutter lessons and matching tests,
that they expect you to cram for, in what has now become a Mockery of Real Education.
Standardization is evil and dangerous, it shows a total misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
it is a dangerous waste of time, that often destroys joy, uniqueness, talent, and other colorful predispositions.
Teachers can only help students to books,
they need to focus on creating and recording quality video lectures.
The greatest education that can be given to student is one afforded by student exchange programs,
beyond that it must be a path they pick; by choosing the materials that interest them.
A standardized education does not have enough depth to help the student grow,
it can only slow them down and restrict them.
An ordinary teacher is one, even a classroom and school is one,
and cannot reach a unique student in a way that they are ready for.
But copies of video lectures, audio books, interactive games, and books,
can! reach every student, and just at the right place in their development.
The world is changing at an increasingly faster pace,
the brittle ideas behind original standardized education never quite lived up to their promise.
Let us work towards replacing standardized education
with life-long personalized education.
Education that drives a student to Authenticity, Knowledge, Independence, Entrepreneurship, and Wisdom,
and not the curse of an uninspired existence born of broken promises, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and depression.</span>

we are full of genius and imagination, and impossible dreams.
We have to take good care for that,
and use our Dignity and Nobility to transcend all limits, and beyond.
There is a very tiny probability,
that we maybe all the intelligence and impossible dreams that the universe has ever seen.
Either way, we are royals, we are special and beyond impossible,
our ability to learn, to out-learn, to out-think, to abstract, is infinite.
We created these little schools that double as babysitters, and distractions,
but we need to make them second to our real education.
And our real education comes from about a thousand books we pick on our own,
and listen and read to throughout our entire life, noting must interfere with that.
You just need to take one step to get the taste for wisdom,
listen to top ten adventure and travel and or hiking or jogging audio books.
The way your spirit grows from taking part in other peoples adventure,
will show you, by subtle analogy, what the countless other steps will help you become.
A wise and great being, adventurer, some kind of an amazing genius,
and a beacon of hope, and light of inspiration, and love.
The lessons you choose with your own heart and mind,
are far more important than the lessons others are trying to make you cram for.
Books will grant you wisdom that will help you avoid regrets,
they will enhance your decision making and long term visions.
Books belong to you,
their wisdom is your intellectual inheritance.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Without reading powerful books written by wise beings,
all we can really do is come up with half-baked conspiracy theories.
Does High School work?
or does it destroy creativity, uniqueness, and self esteem.
Does college work?
Or is everyone participating in a mutually beneficial dog an pony show?
Are we supposed to just get a job? or or build a career?
And what about Start-ups and Entrepreneurship and Invention?
These questions matter, if you are in highs school,
and high school isn&apos;t working, or working out...
Then what actually is going on,
is that you are falling behind on knowledge and wisdom.
It is not that high school becomes easy or irrelevant when it is ineffective,
but that all this knowledge that would give you more insight into the world, is stolen from you.
Without that empowering knowledge;
a good grasp on the human condition, a good intuition for liars, manipulators and cheaters.
Without being well grounded in reality, we&apos;ll be forced into desperation,
into confusion, and all to easily swayed from the paths that we want to walk on.
With a real education, you can operate an online business,
or write software, or become an art fanatic and illustrator without any upfront investment.
You gain so much support from what you can do,
that poverty ceases to be frightening, and you are allowed to develop further.
In school we face this notion of grades and GPA that somehow belittles us,
and then we are led through a standardized education under the banner of balance.
A musician has little interest in biology beyond what a pleasant to read book provides,
in the world of grades it can only distract and hurt, and interrupt their self education.
And yet it appears, that grades exist primarily for getting more funding,
and they are fake, vague, and likely artificially manipulated to show progress.
Participating in nonsense,
can only beget more nonsense.
It is exhausting to try to figure all this out.
But think of a religious college, that puts science second to their particular religion,
think of a diploma mill, and all the colleges that ended up losing accreditation for questionable practices.
Think about all the happy students, all the hard working teachers,
all the nice ladies that made little jokes and loved the students they worked with.
And consider this,
The most complex of lies exist not just simply for gains,
but also because it is highly impossible or cost prohibitive to prove wrong doing, and down right impossible to prove ill intent.
No university professor ever receives an email about now being able to pawn his loose-leaf &quot;books&quot; on the students,
no dean ever asks the professors to let the students cram so that the college can keep their averages high and their accreditation.
These things are implied, assumed, and above all,
part of the very foundation of a for-profit-non-profit that has lobbied not to forgive student loans due to bankruptcy.
There is only one way to answer these questions,
and that is to listen to and perhaps read five to fifteen books on each of these subjects.
We must not allow ourselves to be misled into a life of un-education, and desperation,
a school that can&apos;t provide results better, than you listening to a few dozen audio-books on some fantastic adventure, is worthless.
The first few years after school should be about us trying to build our own businesses,
to see is there is perhaps something better than being overworked for the rest of our lives.
Entrepreneurship is not something that we can memorize,
ideas behind our undertakings have to come from our hearts and souls.
We need a real education for it,
if school is not helping us to our independence, then we must switch to self education.
Years go by pretty quickly when we aren&apos;t progressing forward,
and life has a way of getting ahead of us and challenging us with complexity.
I can&apos;t tell you is schools work or not,
though I am certain that education is life long.
And I can&apos;t pick your books for you,
because only you know the questions that call to you.
But I know that books and especially narrated books and video lectures, that you arrange in a sequence that agrees with you,
and watch at the pace that works best for you, are a powerful way to gain knowledge and to step ever closer to wisdom, and without any distractions.
We owe it to ourselves to find books that help us away from mediocrity,
and help us inherit lifetimes of functional wisdom towards authenticity and independence.</span>
