                  <span class="text-muted">Life is not meant to frighten you,
it is meant to become your most Beautiful Work Of Art.
Even if we had perfect governments and perfect schools,
and became perfectly educated...
...it would still be better for us all, and the universe,
if you stopped following and begun leading to become the Best You.
Yeah, I guess you can&apos;t be a Doctor then,
but being a Doctor is not as lasting as becoming a Great Being.
A great being can heal entire generations,
reminding them of vision, wisdom, and of importance of an examined life.
Very few professionals can go that far out of their way,
and we all need help with Heart, or Fear, or Answers, and the Art of Existence.
A career will not help you make sense of life,
and there will be many challenges as we progress on.
Is it really that foolish to say that Wisdom should come first,
that we should get a solid grasp on things before setting aims?
I suppose that wisdom takes a relay long time,
but that&apos;s not a good reason to make it second to aims we set in High School.
We all agree that we should all be judged based on the content of our character,
and Knowledge and Wisdom is a pretty good way to make it Beautiful.
And things like Fear, Loneliness, or Sorrow cannot be helped by a career,
no matter how well it pays - being Human always comes first.
Only knowledge and the many components of wisdom contained within us
can help us rise to the great many challenges of life.
Learning to become Knowledgeable and Wise is so wonderful,
we just take our audio books on long winding nature trails, and sandy beaches.
We bring our graphite and drawing notepads, even canvas, acrylics and oils,
and all the questions, that we struggle finding answers to in the midst of haste.
And we learn, on beautiful evenings thick with oxygen, and energizing mornings rich with crisp cool air,
so as long as we have access to books that help us inherit wisdom from countless other lives, so that we need not start at zero - we learn.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">It is not always necessary to accurately map the affairs of the World.
sometimes all you need is a vision of a better one.
The world is difficult to grasp because people in authority,
have interests that differ from, the people that vote on them.
Furthermore, low quality schools,
will prevent the voter from making correct choices.
The uneducated or misled majority,
will always be incorrect.
This is why independent, self education,
be it in addition or as a replacement of the national one is a wise idea.
Independent education is one that is paved with curiosities,
and helped along with top-selling non fiction, including narrated books.
Majority of world&apos;s top selling books
are written by well educated and well meaning authors.
Lack of education breeds desperation,
not only will the voters be confused, but the politicians won&apos;t understand them either.
A world where leaders place their needs above the people they swore to represent,
and do the bare minimum for maximum personal gains, is a world that needs vision.
On the other hand, a well educated, knowledgeable and wise voting majority,
isn&apos;t one to get confused, or become mislead, easily.
A vision is always something that most of humanity has already agreed on,
though they might have forgotten parts here and there, or worded them differently.
For example:
Climate Stabilization
Human Dignity
World Peace
Universal Human Rights
World Disarmament
Functional Education
End Of Poverty All Around The World
Universal Basic Income
World Unity
Justice
Authenticity, and Truth.
As we progress from well-read, to knowledgeable, to wise, and onward to our greatness,
we will collect and hold in our hearts many such Hopes and Dreams.
At first they may seem like words or beautiful ideas,
but as we look into Memoirs, and beloved and honored works of great story tellers, they will become more.
With a few dozen books a concept that has been lost on leaders of humanity,
will come to life in our hearts.
Rather than trying to flawlessly comprehend the world,
which may not be possible due to too many liars who by definition lack in vision, and are merely responding to stimuli for maximum self gain.
We gain the ability hold up several of our most beloved Aims, Hopes and Dreams,
and ask what are the leaders doing to fulfill them.
It is much easier to look at a leader&apos;s sum of history,
and notice that they have never done anything meaningful for World Peace and Elimination of Poverty, than to await their promises to come true.
We can then ask, if we want to vote on people who do not recognize World Peace and Elimination of Poverty as an aim,
and what those people must be like.
More importantly, holding a meaningful vision helps us grow up stronger and faster,
helps us focus our energies and curiosities on things that we become passionate about.
When a wise voting majority becomes passionate about Human Dignity,
the strength that arises from Unity of Vision can easily repair World&apos;s Nations and help Humanity Grow.
Without a wise consensus things that are concurring around the world are probably mostly random,
with elections won by those who spend most money on taking on a pleasing shape, and disasters being a predictable result of corruption and shortsightedness.
It is hard to blame leaders and voters for something as disabling as lack of education,
people who lack knowledge pave their ways with their best intentions, alas Humanity&apos;s most beloved works of non-fiction must come first, lest we continue repeating the same old mistakes.
There is nothing difficult
about falling in love with Good Ideas,
When we take to Adventures and Books, and a new book surprises us with a like selection of Hopes and Dreams,
we can only discover how connected we all really are, that we are in fact one big family.
What are your Hopes and Dreams?
What is your Vision of The Future Of Humanity?</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">The legacy you commit to the pages of Human History,
is by definition your greatest and most difficult achievement.
Legacies are as unique as personalities,
so as long as it is meaningful no one is greater than the next.
There is an exception worth noting here,
the legacies of those who have convinced themselves they are not worth the while.
It is always the most delicate ones that lead the way,
step by step, torch in hand.
If you are certain that you haven&apos;t got a story to tell,
then that means you are being called, to tell it.
Greatness is certainly not a requirement for a Meaningful Legacy,
in absence of greatness it will be your legacy, that will make you a Great Being.
Write, write, and protect your journals,
do not make the same mistakes that those who have been permanently lost to history, made.
Every story, begs to be told, every path must be enlightened,
even the most unique of us will have the little ones surely meander by.
Every spirit committed to every book,
will be resurrected and brought to light by some young adventurer in a search for meaning.
Your legacy,
is the inextinguishable light you bring to the world.
And if you so! dare to say,
&quot;I am not a writer...&quot;
Then allow me to respond,
and with all respect, Dear Reader:
If you feel, that you can&apos;t yet write about your life.
Then that can only mean, that you have not yet lived, and that you are in danger.
The danger of life passing you by, but that also means, that you are being called to gentle adventure.
You are being called to find yourself, you are called to restore ancient paths, and you are called to extend and enlighten new ones.
You are a creature of the Universe, and you are meant to connect with the stars, and the lakes and the seas, and breathe, breathe the mountain air.
Make no mistake, you are a Creature of the Universe, not a child, not a student, not a worker, NOT AN OVER-WORKER, but a fine and rare creation of the Timeless and Infinite Universe.
And there is still a faint chance that we are the only Intelligent Species in the Universe, that we are Universe&apos;s only way to know it self.
So, don&apos;t ever think to your self, that you are not a writer, or that you have nothing to say, or that you will live later.
The writing implement nearest you holds the beginning of the thread that will weave the path that many will follow, and learn from in your eternal recurrence.
If you are not a writer, then go home and pack, and start your journey with a sunrise at Haleakala Crater on the island of Maui in Hawaii.
Our Civilization begs constant enlightenment to ensure its progress and survival.
Without the commitment of Greatness and Legacy our momentum will be lost and we will slowly and imperceptibly regress into Dark Ages whilst pointlessly clutching our intercontinental ballistic missiles as the last tree dies.
The liars in authority silently parade the effects of ineffective education as proof that we have no Good Will and can&apos;t have World Peace and Prosperity.
In their madness they can&apos;t comprehend the power of Knowledge, Wisdom, Greatness, and Legacy; as the process of inheriting from great lives of wisdom could not be more alien to them.
It is up to you and every other Honest Human Being,
to for a time become keepers of the flame of Authenticity and Enlightenment, in that endless chain of generations.
The Human Life has traditionally begun with a symbolic journey of many challenges and much intellectual inheritance,
it is in a certain kind of sacred loneliness that we find our beginning, and in private motion forward that we discover our pace of progress.
The liars want you to think that you are a child, and that they are in charge of you,
it is a fraud as old as the most misled of civilizations.
It is you who is all, pick up your journal and let your legacy be discovered by those who are sure to follow,
you may shrug the fools but in the process you cannot help that those who are yet to come will take to standing on your shoulders and following your thread... Ariadne.
Countless many will follow in your path, across many centuries to come,
and few will never let go of your works no matter how ancient your tongue will become.
They will honor your hard won lessons by inhering them directly from you.
The countless will make your aches and lessons count for more.
The most frequent of those who will take to resurrect your spirit in the millennium ahead,
are surely going to be the most Beautifully Melancholy of Mighty Teenagers,
the most rebellious of the rebels, the most Angel-headed of the Hipsters of their time.
Young Poets as melancholy as you, the day you realize that time has finally come to Through-hike the Appalachian Trail.
There will be Artists searching for the stars in the night, as passionate as the last rays of Haleakala Sun come sunset.
There will be Musicians, howling YOUR LYRICS in the night, in hopes of comprehending what you meant in the most passionate of your scribbles.
No, no, you are not a child, or a student, or a worker, you are not waiting for a promotion, you are not wasting your life,
you are an important chain link that connects the past to the future, and more brilliant and more important then the light of all the stars.
And there will be no progress without your journals and poems,
the others are not enough to pave the wisdom forward, it is either all of us, or none.
Therefore, may the beauty of your knowledge create the path that your cheerful wisdom will in turn permanently enlighten,
may you embrace your personal quest for greatness and leave a legacy to kindle many a flame in the countless many to discover it anew.

it is for you so that you may live a beautiful and meaningful life.
It cannot be sold or rented,
because it is priceless.
Nor, can you give it away,
under any circumstance.
Everybody that has something to gain,
will try to push you to work past your limit.
You can&apos;t allow that,
your life is not meant to be spent on work.
You should only work enough,
so that you are safe.
It is hard to keep a balanced existence,
but we must always search and never give in.
We are not machines, nor cogs in one,
we are Music, Poetry, Great Thinker and Dreamers.
We have to protect what makes us beautiful,
overwork can only prevent us from fixing the world.
We are each meant to become well-read,
knowledgeable, wise and an outspoken inspiration to many.
The younger generations are always in need of Great Teachers,
as they all to easily accept the status quo.
All the world nations require great improvement,
and to change the world, we can only rely on Wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Might is meant for battle only,
when battles end, we must return to balance.
Life is meant to revolve around cheerfulness,
or sweet mischief if you are one of those.
It is fueled by knowledge,
driven by wisdom, all towards greatness.
It matters that we are good to ourselves,
that we care about our body and mind.
Some battles such as World Peace,
can&apos;t yet be fought, and we must not try.
If something is too big,
then it will take our cheerfulness and life away.
There is much in the world that needs repair,
but first the world must become wiser.
Before a battle for World Peace is fought,
we must repair schools.
And before we take to repairing schools,
we must first speak out about what is wrong with them.
The wiser our approach to such great endeavors,
the more you will see that it calls for clear thinking.
And clear thinking cannot come,
out of an unbalanced mind.
It requires peace, and cheerfulness, the sun and the moon,
ocean sunshine, snowy adventures, and fragrant woods.
We must be kind to ourselves,
as in haste of might, all our life may pass us by.
And so I offer a small purrsciption,
to ensure that you are forever well.
Above all,
slow down.
Ensure that have time to listen to an audio book each week,
the book need not be long but it must be fascinating.
Prepare a tent and a backpack for this summer,
even if it is just for camping in your backyard.
Get a Mini Projector to trace photos on canvas,
and get some good watercolors, oils or pencils to begin study art.
And to keep heath, search the internet for Dance Tutorials,
and let the music move your body.
You can be sure that you live in balance within your self,
when you have time for self improvement and keeping healthy.
If this is something that you can&apos;t do,
then you must learn to love yourself more, and try harder.
Your health and the way you treat yourself in life,
must be the first and foremost concern.
Because, if you can&apos;t or don&apos;t care about yourself,
then many others will be too scared to care for you.
Haste and Might are handy,
but just for a little while.
Balance, Creativity, Peace, and Health,
is how life is meant to be lived.
Do not be scared to switch majors, or carers, or continents,
be good to yourself, strive to be cheerful.</span>
