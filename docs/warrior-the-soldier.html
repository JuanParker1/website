                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium">Zeno</a> was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.</p>
                    <p>According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for
                      humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not
                      allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear
                      of pain, by using one&#x2019;s mind to understand the world and to do one&#x2019;s part
                      in nature&#x2019;s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and
                      justly.</p>
                    <p>Stoicism would have influenced the Roman Soldier.</p>

                    <p>Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards the
                      vanquished after his success against Germanic tribes. Marcus Aurelius wrote
                      a book titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a> and today it is available as an

                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen">Tomoe</a> (c. 1157 - 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.</p>

                      <h2>Great Strength</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was almost
                      optional. A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into
                      retirement. A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation.</p>
                    <p>It is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we find
                      hard earned inspiration and strength; because there isn&apos;t a soldier that
                      does not ask &quot;Why am I in hell?&quot;.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important lessons to take away from this, is that a soldier
                      is saved inside out, not outside in.</p>

                    </header>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing
                        ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains
                        cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do
                        not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in
                        the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who,
                        for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in
                        the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in
                        the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we
                        call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always
                        room for something more.</p>

                    <h3 id="righteousness">Righteousness</h3>
                    <p>Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in
                      justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all
                      points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and
                      integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</p>
                    <h3 id="heroic-courage">Heroic Courage</h3>
                    <p>Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must
                      have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely,
                      fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and
                      strong.</p>
                    <h3 id="benevolence-compassion">Benevolence, Compassion</h3>
                    <p>Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and
                      strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used
                      for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every
                      opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to
                      find one.</p>
                    <h3 id="respect">Respect</h3>
                    <p>True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their
                      strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but
                      also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes
                      apparent during difficult times.</p>
                    <h3 id="integrity">Integrity</h3>
                    <p>When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done.
                      Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do
                      not have to &#x2018;give their word&#x2019;. They do not have to &#x2018;promise&#x2019;. Speaking and
                      doing are the same action.</p>
                    <h3 id="honour">Honour</h3>
                    <p>Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is
                      themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are
                      a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</p>
                    <h3 id="duty-and-loyalty">Duty and Loyalty</h3>
                    <p>Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything
                      that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are
                      immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are
                      responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</p>
                    <h3 id="self-control">Self-Control</h3>
                    <p>Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of
                      mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over
                      ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and
                      unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.</p>

                    <p>You don&apos;t wait until it is too late, and call in the soldiers. War is Evil,
                      War is Hell.</p>
                    <p>I think we can learn a great deal from Bryan Stevenson&apos;s words <em>Our
humanity depends on everyone&apos;s humanity.</em></p>
                    <p>We are one family, one people, there is no &quot;them&quot;. It is just you, and me.</p>
                    <p>All cultures must leave bad ideas behind, and converge on wisdom.</p>

                    <p>I think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war would
                      spread to no end in time. That, Knightly Virtues, Chivalry, Bushido,
                      Stoicism, would grab a hold of Humanity and never let go, would never stop
                      making us better and wiser. But even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">meme</a> has limitations, the gaps
                      in schooling will end propagation of the most viral lessons, and poverty
                      will return.</p>

                    <p>Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are saying
                      &quot;I have kids, I need to put food on the table&quot;.</p>
                    <p>And one of the lessons we learn from this text is that &quot;A human being is
                      more than the worst thing they have ever done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There is a class of soldier that is a product of their environment. Some
                      are an emergent property of poverty. Maximization of survival, leads to the
                      emergence of a self taught soldier.</p>

Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.

Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
