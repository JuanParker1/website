                  <span class="text-muted">Recordings of lectures and digital materials should be put into public domain.
Schools should not to charge money for recordings of lectures.
Education is meant to be free, for the Good of All Humanity.
An institution may charge money for a live lecture,
with the teacher or professor available to answer questions to those who pay.
But that is not how it should be done,
not in the modern age.
The lectures need to be free,
teachers should be available globally.
There are only so many questions related to the lecture,
it is to everyone&apos;s benefit; to answer all those questions,
and release, a new and updated video and audio recording.
Do not stand in the way of a student,
find a different way to make money, teacher!
An institution that puts a child in debt,
does so at the cost of losing prestige and relevance,
it tarnishes the prestige and hard work of its faculty and administration.
Teachers, Professors, Deans, Administrators,
there is no money to be made by standing in the way of knowledge.
There isn&apos;t a single student on this earth,
whose wisdom does not influence everyone else
By keeping lectures under lock and key, and debt,
you are contributing to the very problem you claim to be a solution for.
Please release recordings of your lectures into the public domain,
work on improving quality and content, and removing any and all remaining access barriers.
Let the children learn,
let them in.
This is the modern age now, the age of Collaborative Encyclopedias, Streamers, Audio Books, and Pocket Computers,
help The Children and Humanity Grow, upload, let everyone in.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">You have to break away,
and start doing the things you love, your way.
You only grow smarter, when you add thoughts together,
and create a greater whole that makes you better.
You have to find your beginning, right now,
find a way to stop listening to everyone, somehow.
Tomorrow never comes, by the way,
come, midnight and it&apos;s already today.
Don&apos;t let life pass you by,
open your eyes, let your imagination become your sky.
Up, is the direction you have to grow,
find what moves you, and follow that flow.
Follow the lessons that you love,
make your own path of education to fit you like a glove.
Lessons can only stick together,
when you love them, when they matter.
If you don&apos;t know where to start,
download audio books to ignite your passion and heart.
Whatever you do,
don&apos;t let school and grades trick you.
All minds are equally powerful,
but our imagination has to become beautiful.
The best way to expand imagination,
is by creating a path of your own exploration.
Think about the way you learned to walk,
what our minds needed to learn to talk.
Learn from non-fiction audio books first,
it is unrestricted knowledge to make you thirst.
Then read about business, and let your imagination soar,
because a diploma doesn&apos;t get you a job anymore.
You need to choose the books and adventures that you love,
the stuff that doesn&apos;t make sense is what you need to get rid of.
Discover the wisdom behind the things you love,
step by step climb higher and above.
We are each a natural born genius, extremely smart,
we each have more than enough to turn our life into beautiful art.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Don&apos;t just try to be the change you hope to see,
it will take more, than just you and me.
You have to move an entire generation, or two,
and they need to be really touched so that they may follow you.
You have to speak out, to inspire,
send a Noble Message that everyone can hear and admire.
Fix schools, and end poverty, both at the same time,
this will help to prevent and stop most crime.
Reality is a fierce and powerful friend,
it is the only thing that will drive blindness to a permanent end.
Look decades into future, make your aims many, but small,
and baby step, by baby step go forward, to meet your goal.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Once and for all, learn to see Your Life as a Whole,
You only get one life, and that whole life is your life.
The whole thing is yours,
but you also have to become,
Great Beings, Mountain Movers, and Mentors.
The little ones need it,
you have to teach them the height you rose to,
so that they may continue,
and not reset back to where you started,
where it all started.
Governments, Laws, Institutions,
Schools Universities and Constitutions,
are Nothing compared to Your Heart, Your Wisdom.
Without Heart and Wisdom, all the machines we created out of paper and paper clips,
and bureaucrats, and democrats, an all the lying rats,
it all turns against us, and we are sent back a hundred years.
Back to war, concentration camps, bullet riddled buildings.
By the powers of Universe we have access to all the future we want,
but to advance forward we must teach, because lessons lost,
come at a great cost, a cost to the little ones,
your daughters and your sons.
To Teach, we must become Wise,
to become wise we must Learn,
not merely age as if we are living in a cage,
you are free to grow.
Grow to see it all,
so that you may know gateway from a wall,
so that the children may stand on the shoulders of giants,
so that their future is that much closer.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">There was a little lady that figured out how to change the world,
all that is known, is that she wasn&apos;t very old.
She posted a single long video, that opened with &quot;I don&apos;t want to be a bother,&quot;
today, everyone just calls her, Mum or Mother.
She said that Democracies require educated voters to operate,
that without real education a Democracy can fill with hate.
&quot;A democratic majority consensus is a really big deal,
without a consensus a nation will always suffer and never heal.&quot;
She spoke of the blight of Fake Education,
she said it lasted long enough to bring her nation down into great desperation.
She said Politics were as fake as Education,
&quot;everyone role-playing and quite blind to the real needs of the nation&quot;
The video was several hours long,
it showed her computer programs and how they brought the world together to get along.
She showed how Nations can invest into the futures of their kids,
creating educational paths with rewards and bids.
Game companies inspired by her imagination,
built it all, her entire virtual nation.
Slowly one by one, cities around the word adopted her program,
to this day it is still true to the original diagram.
Today, marks the programs 500th release,
and we celebrate 500 hundred years of Her Wisdom and World Peace.</span>
