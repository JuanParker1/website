                    <p>this will destroy their minds, this will cause great harm to their self esteem,</p>

                    <p>I think most teachers, when pressured,</p>
                    <p>will tell you that you are expected to learn on your own,</p>
                    <p>and in effect confess, that they are useless, when it comes to teaching you for real.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>That the classroom is about standardized testing,</p>
                    <p>for which it is easier to force you to memorize disconnected bits of knowledge that you will soon forget,</p>
                    <p>then to actually craft a curriculum that will fit all the students,</p>
                    <p>and match their existing knowledge,</p>
                    <p>and the natural pace at which they learn,</p>
                    <p>and their personality.</p>

                    <p>It used to be true that a single teacher cannot approach all their students in a way that will help them learn,</p>
                    <p>so to stay in business, they would force them into memorization.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But today, that is not the case. Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,</p>
                    <p>is because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.</p>

                    <p>interactive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,</p>
                    <p>it is possible to approach each student individually,</p>
                    <p>I am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.</p>

                    <p>There is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">The legacy you commit to the pages of Human History,
is by definition your greatest and most difficult achievement.
Legacies are as unique as personalities,
so as long as it is meaningful no one is greater than the next.
There is an exception worth noting here,
the legacies of those who have convinced themselves they are not worth the while.
It is always the most delicate ones that lead the way,
step by step, torch in hand.
If you are certain that you haven&apos;t got a story to tell,
then that means you are being called, to tell it.
Greatness is certainly not a requirement for a Meaningful Legacy,
in absence of greatness it will be your legacy, that will make you a Great Being.
Write, write, and protect your journals,
do not make the same mistakes that those who have been permanently lost to history, made.
Every story, begs to be told, every path must be enlightened,
even the most unique of us will have the little ones surely meander by.
Every spirit committed to every book,
will be resurrected and brought to light by some young adventurer in a search for meaning.
Your legacy,
is the inextinguishable light you bring to the world.
And if you so! dare to say,
&quot;I am not a writer...&quot;
Then allow me to respond,
and with all respect, Dear Reader:
If you feel, that you can&apos;t yet write about your life.
Then that can only mean, that you have not yet lived, and that you are in danger.
The danger of life passing you by, but that also means, that you are being called to gentle adventure.
You are being called to find yourself, you are called to restore ancient paths, and you are called to extend and enlighten new ones.
You are a creature of the Universe, and you are meant to connect with the stars, and the lakes and the seas, and breathe, breathe the mountain air.
Make no mistake, you are a Creature of the Universe, not a child, not a student, not a worker, NOT AN OVER-WORKER, but a fine and rare creation of the Timeless and Infinite Universe.
And there is still a faint chance that we are the only Intelligent Species in the Universe, that we are Universe&apos;s only way to know it self.
So, don&apos;t ever think to your self, that you are not a writer, or that you have nothing to say, or that you will live later.
The writing implement nearest you holds the beginning of the thread that will weave the path that many will follow, and learn from in your eternal recurrence.
If you are not a writer, then go home and pack, and start your journey with a sunrise at Haleakala Crater on the island of Maui in Hawaii.
Our Civilization begs constant enlightenment to ensure its progress and survival.
Without the commitment of Greatness and Legacy our momentum will be lost and we will slowly and imperceptibly regress into Dark Ages whilst pointlessly clutching our intercontinental ballistic missiles as the last tree dies.
The liars in authority silently parade the effects of ineffective education as proof that we have no Good Will and can&apos;t have World Peace and Prosperity.
In their madness they can&apos;t comprehend the power of Knowledge, Wisdom, Greatness, and Legacy; as the process of inheriting from great lives of wisdom could not be more alien to them.
It is up to you and every other Honest Human Being,
to for a time become keepers of the flame of Authenticity and Enlightenment, in that endless chain of generations.
The Human Life has traditionally begun with a symbolic journey of many challenges and much intellectual inheritance,
it is in a certain kind of sacred loneliness that we find our beginning, and in private motion forward that we discover our pace of progress.
The liars want you to think that you are a child, and that they are in charge of you,
it is a fraud as old as the most misled of civilizations.
It is you who is all, pick up your journal and let your legacy be discovered by those who are sure to follow,
you may shrug the fools but in the process you cannot help that those who are yet to come will take to standing on your shoulders and following your thread... Ariadne.
Countless many will follow in your path, across many centuries to come,
and few will never let go of your works no matter how ancient your tongue will become.
They will honor your hard won lessons by inhering them directly from you.
The countless will make your aches and lessons count for more.
The most frequent of those who will take to resurrect your spirit in the millennium ahead,
are surely going to be the most Beautifully Melancholy of Mighty Teenagers,
the most rebellious of the rebels, the most Angel-headed of the Hipsters of their time.
Young Poets as melancholy as you, the day you realize that time has finally come to Through-hike the Appalachian Trail.
There will be Artists searching for the stars in the night, as passionate as the last rays of Haleakala Sun come sunset.
There will be Musicians, howling YOUR LYRICS in the night, in hopes of comprehending what you meant in the most passionate of your scribbles.
No, no, you are not a child, or a student, or a worker, you are not waiting for a promotion, you are not wasting your life,
you are an important chain link that connects the past to the future, and more brilliant and more important then the light of all the stars.
And there will be no progress without your journals and poems,
the others are not enough to pave the wisdom forward, it is either all of us, or none.
Therefore, may the beauty of your knowledge create the path that your cheerful wisdom will in turn permanently enlighten,
may you embrace your personal quest for greatness and leave a legacy to kindle many a flame in the countless many to discover it anew.

it is for you so that you may live a beautiful and meaningful life.
It cannot be sold or rented,
because it is priceless.
Nor, can you give it away,
under any circumstance.
Everybody that has something to gain,
will try to push you to work past your limit.
You can&apos;t allow that,
your life is not meant to be spent on work.
You should only work enough,
so that you are safe.
It is hard to keep a balanced existence,
but we must always search and never give in.
We are not machines, nor cogs in one,
we are Music, Poetry, Great Thinker and Dreamers.
We have to protect what makes us beautiful,
overwork can only prevent us from fixing the world.
We are each meant to become well-read,
knowledgeable, wise and an outspoken inspiration to many.
The younger generations are always in need of Great Teachers,
as they all to easily accept the status quo.
All the world nations require great improvement,
and to change the world, we can only rely on Wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Might is meant for battle only,
when battles end, we must return to balance.
Life is meant to revolve around cheerfulness,
or sweet mischief if you are one of those.
It is fueled by knowledge,
driven by wisdom, all towards greatness.
It matters that we are good to ourselves,
that we care about our body and mind.
Some battles such as World Peace,
can&apos;t yet be fought, and we must not try.
If something is too big,
then it will take our cheerfulness and life away.
There is much in the world that needs repair,
but first the world must become wiser.
Before a battle for World Peace is fought,
we must repair schools.
And before we take to repairing schools,
we must first speak out about what is wrong with them.
The wiser our approach to such great endeavors,
the more you will see that it calls for clear thinking.
And clear thinking cannot come,
out of an unbalanced mind.
It requires peace, and cheerfulness, the sun and the moon,
ocean sunshine, snowy adventures, and fragrant woods.
We must be kind to ourselves,
as in haste of might, all our life may pass us by.
And so I offer a small purrsciption,
to ensure that you are forever well.
Above all,
slow down.
Ensure that have time to listen to an audio book each week,
the book need not be long but it must be fascinating.
Prepare a tent and a backpack for this summer,
even if it is just for camping in your backyard.
Get a Mini Projector to trace photos on canvas,
and get some good watercolors, oils or pencils to begin study art.
And to keep heath, search the internet for Dance Tutorials,
and let the music move your body.
You can be sure that you live in balance within your self,
when you have time for self improvement and keeping healthy.
If this is something that you can&apos;t do,
then you must learn to love yourself more, and try harder.
Your health and the way you treat yourself in life,
must be the first and foremost concern.
Because, if you can&apos;t or don&apos;t care about yourself,
then many others will be too scared to care for you.
Haste and Might are handy,
but just for a little while.
Balance, Creativity, Peace, and Health,
is how life is meant to be lived.
Do not be scared to switch majors, or carers, or continents,
be good to yourself, strive to be cheerful.</span>

examine life in search for wisdom.
When someone pulls you,
stand your ground.
When someone frightens you,
leave.
You will find no answers,
except, for one place.
Call it the Library,
Books, Video Lectures, or Audio Books.
The only people that deliver Components of Wisdom,
are the authors of top selling non-fiction.
Schools and Nations,
are overwhelmed.
Clogged with uneducated pretenders,
incapable of vision.
They proclaim World Peace,
to be stupid.
And parade Mutually Assured Destruction,
instead.
Grow strong and free,
and learn to no end.
Nobody is coming,
to deliver wisdom unto you.
You!
have to go get the books yourself.
Do not wait,
your knowledge dictates all your decisions.
There are too many liars,
too much mediocrity.
Too much hidden in plain sight,
beneath a shroud of inaction.
The quest for World Peace,
is in your hands now.
The Great Search for Wisdom and Greatness,
awaits you.
Please,
do not delay.
For you are meant to become
a Great Being.
You are to lead the change,
the little ones will soon hope for.
In an incomplete world,
we can&apos;t rest.
Rise for Education, Truth, Peace,
Equality, Freedom and Justice.
The future now begs that all children
are taught to become Great Beings.
May the World grow,
with Knowledge, Love, Wisdom, and Foresight.</span>

is always a lie.
The only thing we will find in a shortcut,
is a fantasy or fairy tale, an impression of education, or make-believe success.
There is really no need to take shortcuts in life,
learning and growing up is beautiful.
Growing up, is an act of endless tiny adventures,
as you pursue your little curiosities onward to wisdom.
Most adventures are very poetic, adventures in spirit so to speak,
such as learning to paint low-brow art with oil on canvas, whilst listening to Kenji Kawai.
Many adventures are actual expeditions that involve backpacks and sometimes even tents,
it still counts, when you only camp in your backyard; an adventure is an adventure.
The more advanced art of listening to audio books when hiking through a little wilderness,
is so pleasant, so relaxing and educational that no one should want to skip it.
When books are read to us,
we really connect with what the author is saying.
Reading books with our own inner-voice, is not perfect because we bring in our own worries and tone,
the book is always tethered down with what is going on in our life and what comes tomorrow.
Books are stories that must be told with passion,
and by an external voice, with some approval from the author; if not the author her self.
It is not possible to walk through the woods, and sticks and roots,
and read a book in such a way that we can hear the author try to teach us wisdom.
Yes, it is important that we walk through green valleys and fragrant woodlands,
it is not the same to listen to a book in the busy streets of a city full of strangers.
Nature has a very powerful impact on us,
it makes us slow down, it makes us calmer, we sleep at sunset and awake at sun rise.
Without fears, distractions, and the hurry of the busy life,
books begin fitting into our lifestyle as our heart begins to call for wisdom.
Nature and Books are opposite of shortcuts, they
create very long and wise lives.
This is a lifestyle of learning and growing up,
it cannot hurt us, it can only make us better, and it will spare us mistakes.
In this kind of life,
no one will push you to hurry up.
No one will frighten you, or lie to you,
here you just cheerfully move at your own speed.
Always thinking,
and always learning, always growing up.
In the life that we are all expected to live,
people lie when they say college will grant you a successful career.
Only you can guarantee yourself a successful career,
and you have to start very early, maybe as early as middle-school.
You have to begin thinking about co-founding a series of tiny companies
that will help you learn about business, and what it means to be a leader, a founder, and a CEO.
You have to discover and follow your passions,
and further your inventions.
Real investors don&apos;t care much for a sales pitch with an elevator cartoon,
they look for genius, passion, sanity, and long therm visions.
On the other hand working for somebody else under several management layers,
does not guarantee a healthy career.
We maybe forced into stress, overwork,
and have all our balance drained from us.
Just because we can work at a breakneck speed,
it does not mean that we should, that kind of lifestyle is very dangerous.
Servitude of this kind will make us age faster,
long after the bosses tried to tell us &quot;life is not fair&quot; we will still suffer from effects of overwork.
We must keep a healthy balance with day and night and nature,
we are not machines, we are poetry.
There are no shortcuts,
and learning is beautiful.
For one you never stop learning, and two; life never stops challenging you,
and three, you must live healthy.
Take good care of your self,
it is the lifetimes of wisdom you inherit from all the books that make the biggest difference.
Life is meant to be lived beautifully and cheerfully;
consciousness is such an impossible gift from the Universe, that without a doubt, you are meant to be happy.</span>
