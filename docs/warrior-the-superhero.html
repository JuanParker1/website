                      <h2>Quote by Lucy Hone</h2>
                    </header>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>&quot;Number One: Resilient people get that [terrible disasters do happen],
                        they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn&apos;t mean they actually
                        welcome it [...] just that when the tough times come they seem to know
                        that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you
                        from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come.&quot;</p>
                      <p>&quot;Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where
                        they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising
                        situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can
                        change, and somehow accept the things that they can&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                      <p>&quot;Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what&apos;s good in
                        your world.&quot;</p>
                      <p>&quot;Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves &quot;Is what I&apos;m doing helping
                        or harming me?&quot; this is a question that&apos;s used a lot in good therapy.&quot;</p>
                      <p>&quot;Is what I&apos;m doing helping or harming me?&quot;</p>

                    <p>By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going
                      forward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beings
                      that we once thought the adults already were.</p>
                    <p>Reaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence is
                      not optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face those

                    <p>if he fails,</p>
                    <p>at least fails while daring greatly,</p>

                      is right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash.
                      And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when
                      you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by
                      Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the
                      culture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of
                      giants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes
                      checking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.</p>

And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished. The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen. We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses. Nietzsche Viktor Frankl State of Mind INVICTUS - W. E.

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
