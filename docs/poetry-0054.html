She spoke of the blight of Fake Education,
she said it lasted long enough to bring her nation down into great desperation.
She said Politics were as fake as Education,
&quot;everyone role-playing and quite blind to the real needs of the nation&quot;
The video was several hours long,
it showed her computer programs and how they brought the world together to get along.
She showed how Nations can invest into the futures of their kids,
creating educational paths with rewards and bids.
Game companies inspired by her imagination,
built it all, her entire virtual nation.
Slowly one by one, cities around the word adopted her program,
to this day it is still true to the original diagram.
Today, marks the programs 500th release,
and we celebrate 500 hundred years of Her Wisdom and World Peace.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence are a fine method,
for resisting the overwhelming power of Cultural Indoctrination.
It is easy to trick ourselves that we know enough, that we will do enough,
but to test ourselves we only need to see if we can write a meaningful book.
But there is other trickery at play,
one that is related to the level of our knowledge, and the content of the culture we grow up in.
This is a more formidable problem,
thus the Thinking Tools are more complex.
Authenticity exposes weakness and lessons,
and The Culture of Pursuits of Excellence, sets us on an adventure of the lifetime.
The Problem of Knowing Enough.
We tend to make decisions that result in not what we wanted,
our intent suffers from not enough experience, knowledge and information.
A good abstract example of that,
is navigating dark woods.
Without a map we maybe headed in the wrong direction,
with a map; we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.
The more we know, the better we navigate,
a powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,
Memoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.
The Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.
Is in observations of the surrounding world,
and hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.
If we are taught a falsehood about the world,
we will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.
A good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,
teaching their children that the other is evil.
It is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,
we tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.
Let me give you an example,
that your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.
When we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,
even though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.
No matter what,
we still believed.
We saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,
we saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.
We saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,
some of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.
We accepted grades,
and we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.
We accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,
we still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.
In the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,
and finally noticed that a diploma didn&apos;t even guarantee a well-paying job.
Late on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,
but a source of regret, a force of erosion.
Many of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,
and never said a single bad thing about schools.
The tragedy of organized education,
is a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.
Now let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both
The Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.
Authenticity.
Accept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.
that&apos;s how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.
Next time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,
also ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.
Dignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,
now add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.
Often times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,
it means that we were purposefully misled.
With Authenticity in our Heart,
we get an extra moment to ourselves.
In context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,
you are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.
No longer will you feel compelled to cram,
because it will feel inauthentic.
After all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,
is not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.
Authenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,
because one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.
However, the price we pay for ease,
is that we don&apos;t really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.
Pursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.
You start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.
This is more challenging, than cramming for tests,
but this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.
The reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,
is the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.
If that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,
or a Startup Accelerator, or your own company from zero.
Then you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,
as you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.
Knowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,
and at a pace that helped you retain most.
Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence,
put us on a path to becoming Wiser Beings.
They will help you see in a world obscured by indoctrination,
or one that lacks real education.

                  <span class="text-muted">Writing is like the spinning top in Inception,
it is a way to self evaluate.
If you continue being unable to write,
then it means you are surrounded by invisible walls.
Being able to lay down your favorite thoughts on a piece of paper,
and helping to inspire or enlighten someone, is a sign of health and inner-freedom, and in some cases Greatness.
There are many styles of writing,
and many directions.
My style of writing is patterned after poems,
I write two sentences per stanza, if I need a third sentence,
then it generally means I over-complicated something.
I think my favorite aim is to turn my little poems,
into little movies and stitch them together into a tiny documentary.
I&apos;ve heard of a project called Love Letters to Strangers
and I find that to be the sweetest aim of all.
In the larger scope,
we must all write to update the surface for future generations to stand on.
The books our parents read are great, by they are a bit old fashioned,
we have to, rebuild the library for the future generations.
We don&apos;t want the future to start with our parents,
we want them to start where we left off,
so that we may spare them the aches we went through.
Things change.
When we talked about climate 50 years ago,
there was still a chance to become educated about it and make informed decisions, today.
But, today, all we got is the observation that climate appears to have become more unstable,
and most are not educated enough to make any sense of it, or agree on any solution.
And that the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife is last 50 years,
people are too desperate for food, money, housing and health, to grasp what that means.
We need a new perspective on dealing with climate change,
because a world uneducated on the subject,
is a world that will never reach a consensus, and may never do anything about it.
Writing a book will tell you if you have the knowledge you think you do,
there are many teenagers, that feel they have mastered Quantum Physics; bless their Great Hearts and Beautiful Minds.
However, they can only write an assay or two,
they can&apos;t synthesize new ideas to fill a book.
Feeling smart is a very healthy sign, that a person is headed in the right direction,
but writing a book is a sign that they have traveled a considerable way there, and are of great health.
You can see what it means to be able to write a book much more clearly in this example in particular,
it means Freedom and Power of Mind, falling short is just... Dreaming.
There is a very powerful kind of book, that perhaps is most important,
and only a young person, during their youth can write it.
Brilliant Teenage Minds that made some headway in life,
writing advice to their peers, that have unfortunately gotten stuck, or fallen.
Opening ones heart at a young age, is a very noble thing to do,
it is a sign of Great Beauty, Compassion and Grand Heroism.
Those books, must not be judged by adults,
their creators must understand not to judge their creative writing by adult standards.
Adults are not what they seem, for one;
and second the people who benefit from those books are teenagers themselves.
A person who is suffering early in their life,
is best helped by the words of someone who has recently managed to rise out of similar problems.
Our youth is the most formative period of our life. Even the smallest of pains spared,
or littlest of mistakes avoided will have massive and profound influence over us, come our middle age.
Write,
write when you are young,
write when you are growing up,
write when nobody seems to be listening.
Write in the face of Liars,
write in the face pretenders, fakers, manipulators, wannabes, and fake-it-until-you-make-it morons.
Write to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps,
write to become a beacon
write to become a light of enlightenment.
Write to bring back what has been written a generation before,
if the story is worth the while, retell it, retell it countless times.
And when you are ready to lay down your pencil for the day,
read, read it out loud, and record it,
because the light in your voice is worth a million books.
And finally,
know what it is all for...
It is how the next generation learns from the previous one,
it is how they win the wars we could only hoped to have won.
It is how they become the heroes we hoped to be,
it is how they save the world, that we can&apos;t see.
Write, because that&apos;s how you! become the hero you hoped to be,
and because the world belongs to the future generations,
not just you and me.
Write.

                  <span class="text-muted">It is pretty embarrassing to be born into a world
where our dear politicians pointed atomic weapons at each other,
and celebrated the peace; that this brought to the world.
I will say that with broken schools or fake education,
we can&apos;t really have the culture in which language can express:
No more war,
please, turn off the rockets.
But that also means, by means of abstract thinking,
we are able to comprehend the Power of Prevention and Education.
By creating a Powerful and Fun, Educational System,
we can Prevent Stupid Ideas from holding the world hostage.
Personally, I think that Self Education
is always going to be better than any Organized Education.
It is always at the right pace, and in the right sequence,
there nothing to stress about, it is just a really beautiful adventure.
Once we feel we know enough, we can begin scribbling,
like I am doing right now.
There is no better way to become a good writer,
than by writing.
And what a fantastic thing it is to be able to package
out most favorite thoughts into little poems,
that page by page, become little books we can share.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Same things may have many different names,
and different things can be called by the same name.
Add liars, manipulators, pretenders,
the vengeful, greedy, and blind.
Add language barriers, national borders,
fake education, indoctrination, censorship,
misinformation, nationalism.
Add manipulation, disagreement, conflict, madness,
hate, apathy, desperation and stress.
Add weapons manufacturing,
and mutually assured destruction.
And there is no more common language left,
for exchange of important ideas.
Maybe there never was,
a common language.
Certainly, we must ensure,
that we do share a language.
Let us set the context, then,
we are an important chain-link,
in an endless progression of Human Generations.
You, are One of One Hundred Billion Human Beings,
to have ever lived.
Billions more will follow,
across millions of years ahead.
We are going to be here for so long,
that Evolution and Science will alter our very appearance.
Our actions will be Judged in the Courtroom of Time,
presided over by all the future generation.
Some, far in the future, may consider out modern times,
hardly distinguishable from Dark Ages.
We don&apos;t get old,
we grow wiser.
Many Great Beings repeat that,
&quot;Old age is a privileged denied to many&quot;.
And eventually,
we will take to the stars.
We are to live Happy, Authentic,
Fulfilling and Meaningful Lives.
There is no time for Lies or Babble,
but there is plenty of time for pursuits of excellence.
And time never stands still,
so much so that there is no such thing as business as usual.
The usual does not last long enough,
to become the norm.
We are to lead the way,
to rise to the challenges ahead.
And to move with such Magnificent Grace,
as to transcend the limits we didn&apos;t even notice we had.
Education and Culture,
is the only things that sets us apart,
from the beings of the Dark Ages.
We progressed out of those times,
by ever pushing forward and above.
By becoming more abstract thinkers,
and by using abstract thinking,
to solve problems,
by subtle analogy to other solutions.
The internet, is the first great step,
towards a Better World.
A world connected with devices,
capable of helping us communicate,
without a single bit of misunderstanding or distrust.
This clear communication interface of the future,
is but a simple engineering problem.
Perhaps, it is a symbolic user interface language,
perhaps a Virtual World,
perhaps a simulated City Government that grows to become the Planetary Government.
But certainly, it is near,
and it will not be stopped,
and it will be a source of truth,
and it will transcend borders,
and it will beam from the sky.
And there will be no room for lies,
no room for manipulations,
nothing to gain by weapons manufacturing,
nothing to gain by hoping to carve humanity with borders,
or deny basic rights.
It will slowly sneak up on those,
who would wish to stop it.
It will sneak up on them by means,
of their very own ignorance and arrogance.
In the world of the future,
we exist as One Humanity.
There is no poverty,
there is no hunger.
And our greatest aim,
is Great Health, Impossible Wisdom,
and simple Cheerfulness and Happiness and Joy.
Captains Log, Supplemental, September 13, 2820
There is a huge unmentionable Universal Debt,
that originally, by mistake, landed on a single credit card,
of an unsuspecting young lady in Belgium
- nobody knows why, including myself!
She was just born the year it happened,
so she didn&apos;t even need a card.
Someone just noticed that all debt was being charged to her account,
never said anything, and somehow, it stayed that way, for many hundreds of years afterwards.
Once she became legally obliged to do something about her debt circa 2040,
it was just cheaper to ignore the account, than to print the bill,
not to mention the bills needed to pay it off.
Notably some decades later,
arguably the most valuable human being on Earth,
would sweetly joke that she was the Most Worthless One.
She&apos;s been paying for everyone&apos;s food,
including all the pizzas economists eat,
so no one dared to say a thing for ages.
Hundreds of years later,
the new generations just assumed,
money was invented to be helpful (certainly not hurtful),
and that Little Chlo&#xE9; was the original inventor.
We are one family, after all,
there is no need to go hungry - never was.
It is of some note, that the most expensive thing she paid for,
was the first Star Ship, the Asteroid class Ark that begun colonizing the Milky Way.
That age was marked by our crossing from Homo Sapiens, to Homo Deus,
and the Star Ship was named, after none other than our little Chlo&#xE9;.</span>
