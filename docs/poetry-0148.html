          <p>My Friends,</p>
          <p>Not only are we unable to directly conjure up the greatest of our heights,<br>
            in that they must ensue from our Greatness &amp; Pursuits.</p>
          <p>But also,<br>
            we can&apos;t see that which we will miss.</p>
          <p>A mistake hidden within the heartbreaking realm of never knowing what we missed,<br>
            an old, odd realm, strangely built with invisible walls.</p><br>
          <p>The only way we can be sure that we have not fallen to some prison of invisible walls,<br>
            is to keep moving forward and up, and never stop.</p><br>
          <p>If our elder selves, do end up, having regrets that begin with, &quot;I wish I knew...&quot;,<br>
            then by pushing forward today, we let them know that we have done our Best.</p>
          <p>We send a message of compassion to our future selves,<br>
            late at night, at 3AM, the older you, will lay awake, and say:</p>
          <p>&quot;I was amazing, there was noting else I could do...&quot;</p>
          <p>Our elder selves need to know that we lived boldly, courageously,<br>
            it is for their health, and so that feel proud, and can get back to sleep with a smile.</p><br>
          <p>I am always sad about never hearing about this from teachers,<br>
            that our life is one, in many profound ways.</p>
          <p>That authenticity is not some ideal,<br>
            but just another name for Health, for Sanity, for Strength.</p>
          <p>When we are older we realize that shortcuts are worthless,<br>
            that they only lead to some sacrifice.</p>
          <p>That throughout our entire lives,<br>
            <strong>the longest way</strong>, was the only way.</p>
          <p>We must each climb the highest of mountains,<br>
            it is how we grow, it is how we bloom,<br>
            it is how the Greatest of Heights will Ensue.</p>
