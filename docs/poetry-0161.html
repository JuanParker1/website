          <p>We are each born to a unique environment,<br>
            family arrangement, economic level, and intellectual culture.</p>
          <p>To be fair, unique environment is good so as long as it it positive, safe;<br>
            it is just as beautiful to walk a Tree Root Bridge as it is Ride a Bull or Tuktuk.</p>
          <p>So as long as it is a place that we can safely grow from,<br>
            a place with a good library of inspirational books of Adventure and Philosophy.</p>
          <p>Family, like the neighborhood has to be safe as well,<br>
            they have to be a source of Wisdom, Encouragement, Knowledge, and Enlightenment.</p>
          <p>Economic levels, are unfair, no child should be put to poverty,<br>
            it is the children of the future generations that repair this.</p>
          <p>Intellectual Culture, must begin with a Love of Wisdom, with Admiration of Independence,<br>
            of Leadership, Inventiveness, Authenticity, Valor;</p>
          <p>The children must be reminded not to throw their youth away on paychecks,<br>
            that time is so valuable; that there are not enough atoms in the universe to strike a coin that buys a single second.</p><br>
          <p>Quarks can be alike, but each quasar, molecular cloud, and Human;<br>
            is infinitely unique in their configuration.</p>
          <p>It is a great tragedy that classrooms often start with the same book,<br>
            that office workers eventually synchronize for the sake of simplicity.</p>
          <p>This is not to be allowed,<br>
            this is not fair.</p>
          <p>This is not the way.</p>
          <p>Each mind is unique and requires a unique combination of books,<br>
            it may not always take many, three to five per year, so as long as they are re-read many times.</p>
          <p>Each book,<br>
            helps us build the construction within - Our Universe, Our City; The Concept Map.</p>
          <p>The sooner we get to the next plateau of enlightenment,<br>
            the safer we are.</p><br>
          <p>If you are a teacher, record audio books, read your books to the students;<br>
            make sure they can take them home, and pause, and think, and replay.</p>
          <p>Look to Science Popularized, Survey Courses in Philosophy,<br>
            help them to get to know some combination the true leaders of this world,<br></p>
