          <p>Life shouldn&apos;t be about beating your best,<br>
            just as important as rising, is your day of rest.</p>
          <p>No matter how important your athletic quest,<br>
            or how upon your arrival you are going to be blessed.</p>
          <p>Everyone, needs to get some rest,<br>
            days will only get longer when you are stressed.</p><br>
          <p>If you must,<br>
            imagine you are a Bird of Fantastic Plumage, and your bed is a nest.</p>
          <p>Come morning, fling up your messy crest,<br>
            and puff up your chest.</p>
          <p>And tweet, about how you are not getting dressed,<br>
            because you are too stressed, and you are having your rest.</p>
          <p>And explain to those confused, that you are not speaking in jest,<br>
            make it clear that this is not, a test.</p><br>
          <p>Today is <em>your</em> day of rest,<br>
            at best, you will be having a nice cup of tea, should you feel pressed.</p><br>
          <p>Allow strength to return to you, so that you are at your best,<br>
            tomorrow, or in few days, you&apos;ll resume your quest.</p>
          <p>Once you are not feeling so stressed,<br>
            you&apos;ll show the world that You are the Best.</p>
