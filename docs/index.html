                      <span class="text-muted">The best way to win against a liar, is to never meet one,
the simplest way to &quot;win&quot; is not to play their game.
This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,
liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.
One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,
they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn&apos;t cause much headache.
But it, looking like an expensive medicine, and costing like one,
when people felt it in their system, they automatically assumed it was working.
This is still going on, and when I was a teenager I actually bought a skin cleanser,
at a pharmacy, in the US, that in no uncertain terms, stated that this was homeopathic medicine,
Home and medicine, sounded good to me,
and it seemed to have been a gentle soap, but it was just the cheapest thing that they could possibly put in a tube.
I checked the top three pharmacies in the US in 2020, and heart-breakingly,
they all continue selling homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
Knowledge and Wisdom, and the path it entails,
is the most wonderful and safest way to avoid all this nonsense.
Because once you become more knowledgeable than the liar,
you will be able to hear them bending words, and twisting stories, the way your Mum was able to pick up on subtle cues when you were lying as a baby.
Now, past some point in an education, many, or perhaps most people, front healthy skepticism first,
not because they assume everyone is a liar, but because they wonder if someone might not have tricked themselves into a falsehood like I did with my homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
More than that, when I was a teenager, and someone asked me if Mokele-mbembe existed,
I would whole heatedly, and with all the love in my heart, say:
&quot;I hope so, after all, it is not a question of their existence, is it now? They used to exist millions of years ago.
It is a question of whether or not there is one or two, left in Rhodesia.&quot; - with a heavy and hairy accent, whilst bouncing my unibrow up an down.
Anybody asking me about cryptozoology was better off,
fronting mountains of skepticism first - the brontosaurus was my favorite dinosaur!
And get this, Brontosaurus is no longer the same thunder lizard we are all familiar with,
it was a misclassification, the dinosaur that you think of as Brontosaurus is actually called Apatosaurus now.
In context of liars, which are pretty damn scary, and only get more frightening as they come together in groups,
...searching for forgiveness, reinforcement and easy pickings to whatever their disorder is; we need to take to knowledge and wisdom as soon as possible.
Middle school, is a pretty good time to start learning for real,
and start climbing over everyone&apos;s heads, to get ahead of things.
Books narrated by their authors,
are an especially precious gift of knowledge.
Bill Bryson has some nice and funny books that help people grow,
A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, and In a Sunburned Country, are beautiful.
But it is best that you start with what moves you,
look at various best seller lists, and keep an eye on non-fiction of you can.
And climb, keep searching for that next book that will agree with you,
and explore everything, explore the world, the trails, the libraries, all the places of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.
It does not take many books to get ahead of liars,
it only takes a few more to get ahead of those that don&apos;t know they are causing harm.
And here the handful of your beloved Memoirs, Biographies, and adventure books,
will transform, to your Sword and Shield, and you will fell many a monster and dragon, onward to a cheerful future.
Start learning on your own, not just to avoid liars and crappy people,
but to become you, the person that you are predisposed to be.
As you grow, there will be some mild regrets, but it is not going to be anything huge,
and whatever you do end up missing by taking your own less traveled road...
Use is as a compass, just because you missed something, it doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t find it again,
feeling like you missed something is a beautiful call to new adventure.
There is nothing to be scared of, by choosing the path of Knowledge, Wisdom, and maybe Greatness,
those are the very components by which humanity grows.
Our superpowers that grant us the abilities to prevent suffering.
making our pains count for more by fixing the problems that hurt us, and preventing others from falling into the same trap.

                      <span class="text-muted">The Universe works in very honest ways,
when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.
When we face impossible problems,
someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.
When governments become too complex,
the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.
When liars start winning all the battles,
your wisdom will become even more precious.
A senator&apos;s boy brought into positions of authority,
by means of favors, shortcuts, and being told what to say, can&apos;t become wise.
Wisdom grows from within our authenticity, dignity, and love,
from clarity of vision, and being moved by generations of giants.
Authenticity helps us up,
wisdom on top of wisdom, plateau by plateau onward to greatness.
Inauthenticity, can only build temporary things,
that soon collapse under their own weight for lack of foundation.
Just because you feel hopelessness,
when you dream about making the world a better place...
It does not mean you should stop loving, thinking, writing,
when the future comes asking: what is next?
Your books are to be complete, beloved, and held in high esteem,
your works must move the world.
All that is true, and worthy of human kind,
requires generations of work, same inspiration, same vision.
May your works serve as the first stepping stone,
a source of rules that will keep Humanity Safe and Sound.
May your works inspire countless generations,
across all the world&apos;s nations.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We have a tendency to take things for granted,
and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.
It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.
The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.
Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.
The world has also become more interconnected,
those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.
Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,
all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.
There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,
the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.
All the fantasies and walls will fade, today&apos;s problem with borders and cults,
is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,
to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.
We are infinite in our minds,
just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.
Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,
something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.
It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,
and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.
This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,
this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.
And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,
the sciences call to everyone.
Personalized education doesn&apos;t really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,
as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.
Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,
and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.
We don&apos;t learn the way schools teach,
we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.
By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,
problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.
A more knowledgeable world,
is a more capable world.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Each generation, including yours, Dear Reader,
is charged with figuring out, what is wrong.
Previous generations discovered many wrongs,
Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.
Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,
we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.
The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,
is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.
Liars everywhere, in the blindness caused by lack of education,
are easily out-competing generations of beings who dedicated their lives to the betterment of Human Kind.
Children are forced to memorize and pretend to learn to get good grades,
and hope to go to colleges and universities that hardly live up to their promises.
Their job search, and school loans,
the way they are treated from interview to retirement does not do them justice.
The younger generations are the Sacred Hope and Future of Human Hind,
but they are now exploited by old fat lice who cannot stop feeding even if their life depends on it.
The teachers in their haste to bring a little paycheck home have lost the respect for students,
professors now sell home-made textbooks as ineffective as their lectures, and universities.
The children can see all this,
they understand the minds of these failures.
They merely need to ask:
&quot;How would I have to think, and how low would I have to sink, to do as they do.&quot;
Humanity requires a real educational system to effectively pass knowledge between generations,
when we finally create it, we will see blind stupidity and all the evils it fuels, fade.
My friends, this is not a difficult project,
we come together to record video lectures, write and narrate books.
We pay,
for outstanding contributions and translations of these lectures.
That payment,
is the grade.
We create a massively multiplying and overlapping global educational system,
that has no structure, and countless redundant paths towards knowledge, excellence and wisdom.
Those paths,
are the diploma.
Companies that show compassion, worth and balance,
inspect these paths in search of talent.
Even so, students are encouraged to build multi-founder start-ups,
throughout the world and their lives.
This world school, is not an neat addition to this world,
this school: Becomes Our World.
It becomes our point of convergence on World Peace,
and the Library of Ideas worth keeping.
The fundamentally broken naysayers will come,
as the erosion of the good ideas and propagation of war, poverty, and all other bad ideas is their food.
But those who stand against Prosperity, Unity, Knowledge, Wisdom and World Peace,
are just an animated rotting corpse that needs to be left behind in the poverty and desperation they once exploited to their advantage.
For the sake of the future generations,
let us rise against evil and mediocrity.
May we abandon all that moves against the grain of reality,
and all that is fake, ineffective, and lacking positive, real, and permanent results.
Let us cradle the future generations in Knowledge, in Wisdom, and in Greatness,
and honor them and their challenges, with World Peace.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We can&apos;t have a standardized education,
because that would require a standardized life.
A life in which we are only passionate about
what we are told to be passionate about.
A life, where memorization,
does suffice.
My friends, the standardization of your existence,
is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.
A standardized existence is one
where your mind is taken from you.
Just like you recoil at the thought of a standardized breakfast,
the words standardized education should make you feel sick!
Even if you could learn by being taught like a little bird is fed,
how could you allow someone to pick the knowledge for your mind?
Allowing someone to insert standardized lessons into your mind is disgusting,
you are a unique and sacred being, born a genius and meant to be driven to wisdom and greatness.
You are meant to be the hope and dreams of all the past generations,
school, job, career, retirement and some promise of world travel is not how real life works.
The people in charge of creating early schools might not have had the opportunity
to create schools that are capable of inspiring the students to great heights.
Since, we have only updated that imperfect first attempt at mass education,
we lost the original dream of helping the world become Knowledgeable and Wise.
Today, teachers create cookie cutter lessons and matching tests,
that they expect you to cram for, in what has now become a Mockery of Real Education.
Standardization is evil and dangerous, it shows a total misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
it is a dangerous waste of time, that often destroys joy, uniqueness, talent, and other colorful predispositions.
Teachers can only help students to books,
they need to focus on creating and recording quality video lectures.
The greatest education that can be given to student is one afforded by student exchange programs,
beyond that it must be a path they pick; by choosing the materials that interest them.
A standardized education does not have enough depth to help the student grow,
it can only slow them down and restrict them.
An ordinary teacher is one, even a classroom and school is one,
and cannot reach a unique student in a way that they are ready for.
But copies of video lectures, audio books, interactive games, and books,
can! reach every student, and just at the right place in their development.
The world is changing at an increasingly faster pace,
the brittle ideas behind original standardized education never quite lived up to their promise.
Let us work towards replacing standardized education
with life-long personalized education.
Education that drives a student to Authenticity, Knowledge, Independence, Entrepreneurship, and Wisdom,
and not the curse of an uninspired existence born of broken promises, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and depression.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We all start with a Great Dignity, and Great Nobility,
we are full of genius and imagination, and impossible dreams.
We have to take good care for that,
and use our Dignity and Nobility to transcend all limits, and beyond.
There is a very tiny probability,
that we maybe all the intelligence and impossible dreams that the universe has ever seen.
Either way, we are royals, we are special and beyond impossible,
our ability to learn, to out-learn, to out-think, to abstract, is infinite.
We created these little schools that double as babysitters, and distractions,
but we need to make them second to our real education.
And our real education comes from about a thousand books we pick on our own,
and listen and read to throughout our entire life, noting must interfere with that.
You just need to take one step to get the taste for wisdom,
listen to top ten adventure and travel and or hiking or jogging audio books.
The way your spirit grows from taking part in other peoples adventure,
will show you, by subtle analogy, what the countless other steps will help you become.
A wise and great being, adventurer, some kind of an amazing genius,
and a beacon of hope, and light of inspiration, and love.
The lessons you choose with your own heart and mind,
are far more important than the lessons others are trying to make you cram for.
Books will grant you wisdom that will help you avoid regrets,
they will enhance your decision making and long term visions.
Books belong to you,
their wisdom is your intellectual inheritance.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Without reading powerful books written by wise beings,
all we can really do is come up with half-baked conspiracy theories.
Does High School work?
or does it destroy creativity, uniqueness, and self esteem.
Does college work?
Or is everyone participating in a mutually beneficial dog an pony show?
Are we supposed to just get a job? or or build a career?
And what about Start-ups and Entrepreneurship and Invention?
These questions matter, if you are in highs school,
and high school isn&apos;t working, or working out...
Then what actually is going on,
is that you are falling behind on knowledge and wisdom.
It is not that high school becomes easy or irrelevant when it is ineffective,
but that all this knowledge that would give you more insight into the world, is stolen from you.
Without that empowering knowledge;
a good grasp on the human condition, a good intuition for liars, manipulators and cheaters.
Without being well grounded in reality, we&apos;ll be forced into desperation,
into confusion, and all to easily swayed from the paths that we want to walk on.
With a real education, you can operate an online business,
or write software, or become an art fanatic and illustrator without any upfront investment.
You gain so much support from what you can do,
that poverty ceases to be frightening, and you are allowed to develop further.
In school we face this notion of grades and GPA that somehow belittles us,
and then we are led through a standardized education under the banner of balance.
A musician has little interest in biology beyond what a pleasant to read book provides,
in the world of grades it can only distract and hurt, and interrupt their self education.
And yet it appears, that grades exist primarily for getting more funding,
and they are fake, vague, and likely artificially manipulated to show progress.
Participating in nonsense,
can only beget more nonsense.
It is exhausting to try to figure all this out.
But think of a religious college, that puts science second to their particular religion,
think of a diploma mill, and all the colleges that ended up losing accreditation for questionable practices.
Think about all the happy students, all the hard working teachers,
all the nice ladies that made little jokes and loved the students they worked with.
And consider this,
The most complex of lies exist not just simply for gains,
but also because it is highly impossible or cost prohibitive to prove wrong doing, and down right impossible to prove ill intent.
No university professor ever receives an email about now being able to pawn his loose-leaf &quot;books&quot; on the students,
no dean ever asks the professors to let the students cram so that the college can keep their averages high and their accreditation.
These things are implied, assumed, and above all,
part of the very foundation of a for-profit-non-profit that has lobbied not to forgive student loans due to bankruptcy.
There is only one way to answer these questions,
and that is to listen to and perhaps read five to fifteen books on each of these subjects.
We must not allow ourselves to be misled into a life of un-education, and desperation,
a school that can&apos;t provide results better, than you listening to a few dozen audio-books on some fantastic adventure, is worthless.
The first few years after school should be about us trying to build our own businesses,
to see is there is perhaps something better than being overworked for the rest of our lives.
Entrepreneurship is not something that we can memorize,
ideas behind our undertakings have to come from our hearts and souls.
We need a real education for it,
if school is not helping us to our independence, then we must switch to self education.
Years go by pretty quickly when we aren&apos;t progressing forward,
and life has a way of getting ahead of us and challenging us with complexity.
I can&apos;t tell you is schools work or not,
though I am certain that education is life long.
And I can&apos;t pick your books for you,
because only you know the questions that call to you.
But I know that books and especially narrated books and video lectures, that you arrange in a sequence that agrees with you,
and watch at the pace that works best for you, are a powerful way to gain knowledge and to step ever closer to wisdom, and without any distractions.
We owe it to ourselves to find books that help us away from mediocrity,
and help us inherit lifetimes of functional wisdom towards authenticity and independence.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">All that has ever gone wrong,
has gone wrong due to rejecting realities, and accepting, fantasies.
To deny truth, is to create a terrible fantasy,
and no human being should ever be committed to one - as life is far too precious.
Yes, fantasies in a sickly way are more comfortable,
than the authentic life that unfolds by rules independent from our wishes.
But rejecting pleasant fantasies is no different
than the rejection of drugs.
It is simply not who we are,
and not where healthy people wish to be, or can possibly grow.
It is not that the world is too difficult to grasp,
but that, too many people are suffering from lack of knowledge.
Knowledge is found in books, best experience in their audio form,
and on a pleasant and relaxing adventure.
Books whose authors are admired for their hard work, clarity of long therm vision,
intelligence, wisdom, and often a wonderful sense of humor.
Alas, far too many people take to relive their fears by,
by constructing a view of the world they can understand and control.
All fantasies will eventually call for reinforcement,
and as history shows, at any, and all cost.
Be it something as tiny as the number of likes on a social network,
as odd as the status that pointlessly-expensive-cars bring.
Or something as heartbreaking as political systems,
where fathers will easily send their children to kill each other in battle fields.
A fantasy will call for reinforcement,
to keep it going to make it last, and no price will ever be too big.
Reality, is much harsher and not as comfortable or easy to grasp,
will call for constant effort, hard earned foresight, real and lasting results to our endeavors, and authentic dignity.
In reality; color of skin, numbered of colored pieces of paper, or the colors of a flag,
do not define who is superior, and who is inferior, who is better and who is worse.
In fantasy, poverty and war, are facts of life,
in reality, Love, Health, and World Peace, are, the most beautiful rewards for the most difficult of achievements.
In fantasy we crated tens of thousands of gods and as many battles in their worship,
in reality we invent Flight, try to get to the Moon for no clear reason, and even fantasize about Interstellar Travel to cross the galaxy.
In reality there is no evil, just a steady and colorful progress forward, we build Nuclear Plants and not Nuclear Missiles,
in fantasy evil oozes from the cracks that mad men must keep patching to prevent their small minds from falling to a thousand pieces.
Fantasies spread with culture,
they quite imperceptibly trick us into thinking of ourselves as other than we really are.
For example, if you don&apos;t believe you can be a genius,
you will not be able to become one, you&apos;ll never aim for it.
The longer you delay, the more obstacles will arise in your path
if you don&apos;t believe you can cross that challenge, you won&apos;t even try.
If you grant others control over your time, or life,
you will only limit yourself and how far you can travel.
Your mind is powerful enough to host cities of thoughts and dreams of, any size,
the only limit to your intelligence is the ability to mistakenly stop your self by accepting some falsehood.
Love, genius, empathy, foresight and insight, and spirituality exist within us all,
but without knowledge and eventual wisdom they too are limited and fall short.
Yes, at first, the real world is unknown to us,
but it is not meant to frighten us into creating fantasies that we think we can grasp.
It simply requires that we listen to a hundred books,
take a moment to explore the world around us with our new found experience...
And then very slowly and very gently as our long lives unfold,
listen to, and read, just about nine hundred more as not to ever fall short, and always have a beautiful story to tell.
We are sure to become wise, with all the building blocks we gain from books,
and then, if should we wish, we can turn right around and create some new books for others to read, and grow up with.
Do not be scared my friends,
as scary as poverty is, its power flows precisely from lack of education, wisdom and above all foresight.
The more knowledgeable and wiser the world,
the more overwhelming the force to crush poverty.
Growing up to become knowledgeable and wise as opposed to merely age in some easy fantasy,
is critical for our mental health and well being.
A thousand books you can listen to while traveling worlds most beautiful hiking trails,
is hardly a challenge, it shouldn&apos;t even be seen as a inconvenience.
Inheriting real and functional knowledge, that has a powerful and lasting impact on our growing up,
that enriches and enhances our decision making bringing us clear visions and impossible dreams is a great reward.
Becoming broke, or homeless, never being able to get a job, and being seen as a waste of life,
is not something that can happen to a wise a beautiful person that rejects fantasies in search of truths.
And it is important to remember,
that we can&apos;t graduate a by cramming and temporary memorizing disconnected facts.
A fake education,
is a meaningless education.
Companies known for hiring such inauthentic individuals are full of life draining liars and pretenders and probably in high positions,
whatever they build cannot be built with vision and wisdom, it can only self destruct.
Once you become self educated,
you are granted the opportunity to build your own companies with foresight and invention.
My dear reader, I would bet building an open and grade-free school that actually educates its students will be high up on your to-do list.
Building companies only becomes stressful when you build them for their own sake due to lack of vision,
when you enter on the path towards wisdom, you won&apos;t merely aim to impress investors, you will move generations.
It is OK to blindly set off towards wisdom,
it is one of the few leaps of faith that are worth the while.
Whatever your aims, may you inspire countless dreamers to greatness,
and may you reject all fantasy, holding authenticity and wisdom as the highest of values.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We, or the younger generations may find ourselves in situations where life does not make sense,
where too many things are contradictory, ineffective, and too broken to be of any real use.
When we are children we are taught falsehoods,
indoctrinated into religions, made to think of politics as special, and schools as critical.
We have no chance to question anything,
we have no experience at all.
Religions, broken politics and ineffective schools feed on blind belief,
if we taught children the truth they would try to help the world grow.
Plus, it does not take very long before life gets real, with bullies, rockets, wars, or illnesses,
and when we are placed on an imaginary foundation, we can&apos;t quite fight all that back, not very effectively.
Educated or not, Human Beings are still very special, and will fight for what little they know,
it is a terrible tragedy when people fight for something imaginary, that in the end, means nothing.
Just out of respect for children, and for the future generations to whom this planet truly belongs to,
we must resist propagating fantasies and myths.
The governments are not external forces, and they are not fully functional,
they are made to be ran by the people of their nations, and depend on schools that produce real results.
We can&apos;t teach the younger generations that World Peace is a funny fantasy,
World Peace has been the next important step for a century now.
Levels of education, wisdom, and greatness all around the world, need to increase,
while schools do work to some degree, they mean little when compared to self education and real results.
It is cruel to teach children lessons that will frighten them with a world that does not make sense,
all-the-while real life is happening and they need real facts and not imaginary opinions and wishful thinking.
Worst of all, we propagate myths because it is easier to pass on a faerie tale,
than to read a thousand books about the world and growing up.
Let us all put an end to this cycle to strangeness,
let us all aim to become self educated with world&apos;s finest books and lectures, onward to becoming wise.
Let us inspire the younger generations with facts and not mere opinions,
and let us remind, that the world and the politics and schools that demand great repairs, all belongs to them.
May we all rise and rise,
until the world becomes wise.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">The best kind of trouble is the trouble you create for yourself,
there is no limit to how elaborate of a problem you can invent.
Relativity and contrast play a very important role here,
the lower you are and the higher you aim the more it is worth the trouble.
It is safe to say that a nice and comfortable bed with an electric blanket,
on a quiet and sleepy afternoon is a pretty good low.
A pretty good height to reach is either ten miles by foot,
or 1,500 miles by car where it usually involves a beach somewhere.
Moreover, you need a team deadline, a snooze button, a soon to end semester,
and an ungrateful team where you do all the work, add a few bullies...
and your co-worker whispering:
&quot;Why did she get a raise, she doesn&apos;t know anything&quot; - emphasizing &quot;she doesn&apos;t know&quot;.
While not purrfect, this is a really good start,
and erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.
There are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,
and a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.
See, you are not just headed for Key West and back,
I m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.
A good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,
it is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.
I think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,
they are usually there because something beautiful is going on.
You never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,
it could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.
Personally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,
but it is fine for a woman.
And you certainly don&apos;t want to realize come your late golden age,
that you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.
Now, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,
to wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.
An hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,
it won&apos;t be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...
...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,
how nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.
It is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,
there is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.
In real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,
and do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger&apos;s road - that ain&apos;t good.
Eventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,
and stop at the next park.
The more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,
you can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.
Now, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,
be good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won&apos;t last long at all.
Don&apos;t make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,
and figured why don&apos;t I use a pencil at first...
...smart right?
It took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,
treat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.
If you want to speak at length,
do what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.
Healing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound &quot;dumb&quot; to you after a bit,
but that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.
A lot of people will stay in bed,
they will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.
There is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,
she could then come around and tell them &quot;Hey! you will never get a raise again?&quot;, that could still snap them out of it.
But, if the boss is not fully crazed,
you are their last hope.
The trouble you go through to learn to jog,
or try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.
As all end of the road towns are tourist traps,
so, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.
Except maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,
very few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.
Yeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,
to all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.
No human should lead the life of a house cat,
we are very dynamic, and doing beautiful unusual things helps us stay healthy.
One, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,
it was clearly the husband&apos;s idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...
It was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,
and not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.
I am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,
now the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.
I am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,
and thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.
Between the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.
That this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.
They stayed the weekend,
but they needed at least three weeks if not months.
They needed to stop racing forward,
they needed more adventures, more &quot;inconvenience&quot;, more trouble-making as I call it.
That woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,
she had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.
See emanated the mana that bespoke that,
the standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.
Anyway, still a glorious couple,
and their little one will surely grow up to be an adventurer.
Aside from a raccoon I named Friday, using his cute little hands to soil my hot dog buns,
that week brought in another mighty being - this time a teenage boy.
His father passed away, and he pushed himself too far,
the psychologist put him on permanent medicine.
I had the great honor of speaking to him, he told me he slept in fields and ditches,
but he had his sister, or mom, looking out for him.
He was a Powerful Troublemaker,
I told him we need to care for ourselves, our bodies need vitamins, electrolytes, our minds need whatever they need.
&quot;There is no such thing as crazy,
you just went through a lot in life, it was your life that got crazy.&quot; - I said to him.
A thousand miles on a bicycle, which according to my maps requires a little trip to Canada, and a ferry,
is all the proof needed that the kid was really special.
I returned to my camp, and a day or two later,
a shadowy figure visited him, his mom probably, and without me paying attention I&apos;ve noticed it was a slow and mighty, and very heavy conversation.
Knowing he was well, I hope he continued his bicycling, at least to the upper peninsula,
though there was a ferry near by, so maybe he was headed for Chicago, I hope they both went.
See, here is a child well on his way to become a great being,
he was learning wisdom, and all he needed was backpack, a bicycle, and a thousand miles of road.
Trouble-making is no joke, it an art,
and it is medicine worthy of great heroes.
If you, my Dear Reader, get stuck, or stung, or scared, or get stuck in a fog of war,
know that it is not a time to try harder, and push harder, and let me tell you why without mincing words:
Because you are absolutely irreplaceable,
and - what you think your flaws are - aren&apos;t, they are not flaws, this is your uniqueness.
You will only exist once in the universe,
and though you can rain wrath precisely like a god, you also need to pace yourself.
The best kind of a Warrior is a Laughing Philosopher,
not a Berserker (that&apos;s too easy), be an Artist.
It is a huge part of the art of living,
to quit blaming yourself for being angry, or clumsy, or never finishing anything you start, or never finding the right person.
You are not angry, there is nothing wrong with you,
you just took on so much weight and made so many compromises that there is no more time left for you to be yourself.
I know it sounds awful when I say something as simple and go ride a bicycle, or a horse,
or give the campsite raccoons so much anxiety that they start clawing their way into nice people&apos;s backpacks.
But that is how it works, the way out of fog of war,
must be simple so that you have no trouble taking it.
No one is asking you to drop out of school permanently,
you&apos;re not going to be homeless, you will find a better job.
You only need to say the truth to your next employer,
your mental health, and your joy of life, and a balanced existence is critical to a healthy existence.
Just because someone can lay down their life to meet a deadline whilst kissing ass and never asking for a raise,
it does not mean anybody healthy will ever try.
If principals or teachers, or management or anything gets crazy on you,
don&apos;t quit, just don&apos;t comply because doing so will hurt you, just take a vacation, because your mental and physical health is more important than anything else, period.
If you are still not hearing this, if you are still not ready not to sacrifice yourself,
let me say this, there is a lot of people out there who like that Mighty Teenager do have a breaking point that will scare the bajezus out of a shrink, who is only too happy to prescribe something.
Your self-compassion, your dignity, your beauty,
and the power that your laughter, your foolishness, your silliness, your mischievousness, and above all your giggles exert on the universe that surrounds you is to important to us all for you to keep walking a path that is hurting you.
You are irreplaceable, and when you rise, and choose to share your stories,
you will build roads for others to follow.
By not putting up with what is hurting you,
you make the Universe a better place by becoming a beacon of sanity for those who will hear of your adventures.
Returning to school or job with with this dignity and integrity of mind,
will change the way people treat you.
Not just your confidence, but your wisdom, and strength, and balance,
will alter your body language.
Stressed people and relaxed people, give off different behavioral clues,
people including those in charge of budgets can read that very easily.
Terrible people who lack compassion are everywhere,
sometimes stressed out people will be abused with more stress just because they keep taking it on.
Things get supremely complicated,
in ways that we can&apos;t always understand.
For example the reason why someone loses their 4.0 may have nothing to do with their performance,
but with the teacher giving out too many A/s in the previous semester, and now just trying to average things out with the people who never complain, so that the dean doesn&apos;t come around complaining that his class sticks out.
It doesn&apos;t matter if it is High School, or College, or what used to be a Dream Job,
there are unethical fake it until you make it people covering their asses everywhere, it is a tragedy that someone like that should become a reason behind someone&apos;s years of suffering.
These are simple examples I am making up,
in real life, there is no understanding of all the motives as people who never grew up, constantly interact with each other to to do less, and get more,
Trouble-making is just a lighthearted way of leaving all that noise behind,
and regaining your own beauty, and strengths, and awe for the world around you.
Give yourself some trouble that actually makes you better for a change.
if the path you re walking on feels wrong, you need to begin preparing an adventure backpack.
A very special Monday is coming around,
your clock will go off just like always.
But this time it will die with a sad whimper as you - slowly and deliberately - unplug it from the wall,
and return to sleep, not worried about your deadline, job or school, but simply knowing full well, that they don&apos;t matter anymore; because your well being is infinitely more important.
Then get into your car, or on a bus, and set a direction for sunny weather,
drive, fly, just go, and do not wait to create your rules of adventure, do it as soon as possible.
When your health returns to you,
you&apos;ll know exactly where you are going, and schools will always take you back, and jobs that hurt you are now worthy of your concern at all.
Don&apos;t make plans about the rest of your life until you catch up where you need to be and become wiser as think things through.
And finally, if you don&apos;t like the idea of trouble making,
then between You and I let us call it: Love of Life.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Though mighty, we are very delicate creatures,
our minds require Beauty and Calm to learn the most at their best.
Haste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,
homework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.
Learning for real, real education, useful knowledge,
thriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.
In real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,
doesn&apos;t actually do anything.
Reality, demands real things,
truth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.
A beautiful life,
requires our full beauty.
To bloom, to truly grow up,
we need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.
It is not as easy as it sounds,
though we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.
What about, the less obvious things?
Such as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,
but on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.
So you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?
that is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?
And what about the quality of that test,
and what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?
And what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,
in effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.
And what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,
what if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?
Reality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,
but you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.
At no point should you be pushed to the side,
and forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.
And do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,
spending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn&apos;t guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.
Now, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,
and eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.
So, High School, College, University and a Career,
does not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.
If you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,
you can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.
Just for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,
and zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.
Cults and religions are not the only indoctrination,
they are just the ones that are trivial to catch.
A Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,
but even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.
Even an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,
as you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.
Lets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,
is a sign that you are being taken advantage of.
Learning is not about memorization,
and memorization has nothing to do with learning.
Memorization is best used in poetry,
it a way to give thanks to poets.
Even if you memorize numbers of a new language,
all you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.
Memorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,
is almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.
To learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,
watch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.
We are good at language,
just like we are good at dance, don&apos;t force it, love it.
Your Knowledge is sacred,
it empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.
When someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,
you must become very suspicious of their motives.
The world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,
sometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.
You have to find a way to learn things right,
I think we all know, that way, is not the school way.
I know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,
but you see, that won&apos;t go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.
Moreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,
you become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.
It is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,
it is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.
The way to push back against manipulators,
is to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.
At most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,
though they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.
25 audio books is like a month of your life,
and, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.
You will always return to where you were as you read them,
so you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.
You can either start your life with a heart break,
or with adventure and audio books.
Grab your friends, tell them to behave,
and go together.
If I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,
as neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.
I found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,
it fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can&apos;t even.
Look for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,
and keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.
Use the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,
they are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.
That is all you need, to create an adventure,
a path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.
And promise to drive carefully,
you are not in a hurry.
Now, not everyone is ready to write,
but some of you are a lot further along than you think.
Begin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,
and that&apos;s it, don&apos;t press, flow.
Just like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,
and need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.
My friends, same goes for our minds,
fear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.
Do you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?
Impatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,
sadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.
These are not things that we can fix, you can&apos;t take pain killers for body aches from from fear.
By calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,
but it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.
In a way, psychology is a young science,
it is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.
There aren&apos;t too many answers here,
but there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.
The secret to a long and healthy life is:
Happiness.
I am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,
and get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.
Happiness is quite a thing,
it is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.
Where wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,
happiness makes you a powerful doctor.
The low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,
that will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.
Has the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,
and plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.
I once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,
and somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:
The Laughing Philosopher.
While, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,
I am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.
And I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,
or dragged away by a condor.
And I know for certain, that the saddest of us,
are the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.
All you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,
that the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.
Fight the urge to turn the car around,
that is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.
It will only take a few days,
and then, everything changes.
Oh my, when you get out of your car,
and your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.
By taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,
you can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.
And hearing your first chipmunk,
will absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.
No job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,
has any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?
You joy of life is sacred,
everything else has to be secondary.
You are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,
when you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.
Call it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,
but keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.
Because that will mark the rise of your own personal University,
and the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">School, wisdom, philosophy, job, university, career, writing, politics, adventure, grades, greatness, soul,
how can you tell which of these are real, outdated or just not worth your time?
By finding your beginning, of course,
and then weaving an unbroken thread that makes you rise.
We are born of chaos and accident, but we are a masterpiece of the Universe,
the time required to permute all combinations of chemicals to give rise to life is, long.
We are here, because as unlikely as life is,
eventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.
When you look around this planet,
despite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.
I think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,
but unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can&apos;t build cities of thoughts and dreams.
In a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:
rare.
In two words:
Beautiful and Rare.
We have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,
and see what we can weave with it.
In the misery of cold caves,
or the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.
In the dark ages of child labor,
or the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.
In the age of Mustard Gas,
or poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.
In the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,
Cold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.
But in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,
where what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.
We grew,
my friends, it happened just now, just like that.
A new way of learning:
Audio Books on The Trail.
No university lecture,
can beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.
Unlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,
or in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.
A professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,
but he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.
A memoir,
will.
All the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,
to books about the promise of World Peace...
And if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,
by contrast a Professor&apos;s smile is meaningless, if not fake.
Professors can only interfere with your development,
no single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.
While your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,
there is something else, you need.
You need a taste of Greatness,
you will never find it in a University town, never.
There is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,
those are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.
When you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,
in rain in snow...
...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,
I am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.
For how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,
by putting you into a little dorm room.
And no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,
to impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.
How could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,
than your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.
No professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,
as a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.
And the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening&apos;s bonfire,
that thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.
He wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,
but you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.
Let the trail,
become your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.
SPEAK OUT,
do not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.
SPEAK OUT,
do not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.
SPEAK OUT,
tell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.
Speak Out,
speak out.
In wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,
it is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.
The Trail,
and that thread, are one and the same.
And the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,
in cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.
After a few years,
what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.
A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,
and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.
Your own book,
will start.
And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,
and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.
That&apos;s how you will know what is real,
what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.
Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,
wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.
And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,
you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.
Take your self-education to the trails,
the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.
Don&apos;t worry, it will be OK,
so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.
And the last thing a Great Being discovers,
is the answer to their first big question &quot;Who am I?&quot;, it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.
Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,
and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Do you remember wondering about becoming an adult?
wanting to be done with this dumb kid stuff and have Ice Cream... even in winter.
Just being half pint is not that big of a deal,
it is the not knowing, what adults know, that&apos;s the hard part.
For some of us this is a book, or a manual, or the mystery of philosophy,
but what we are actually trying to picture is... Wisdom.
Even as babies we know that wisdom separates a child from an adult,
it isn&apos;t just about growing older, anybody can just age, it is about Wisdom.
Much of Wisdom comes from inheriting lifetimes of knowledge from books,
the problem here is, that it is only one in ten books that will connect with us.
When we stop on the ninth book,
we also stop growing up.
Standing still cuts Humanity with borders,
in the face of lack of wisdom we fall to self-deception, or fantasy.
And the first thing that deception and fantasy needs is reinforcement,
in desperation to make it as real as possible, we utter that horrible curse:
&quot;Mine is better than yours&quot;,
Be it color of skin, name of god, or country,
only more divisions will follow.
We divide in politics, medicine, neighborhood, opinions, rarity of cars, price of clothes,
and sometimes even the price of shoes, and whether or not we can really afford them.
Without wisdom, Humanity&apos;s collective vision becomes unclear,
and we begin moving in different directions, divided we will never find Peace.
Let us take to wisdom, let us return to searching for beautiful books and adventures,
may we grow, and converge on wisdom in our magnificent uniqueness.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Wisdom, is our Universal Language,
imagine two wise beings from nations that dislike each other.
There is nothing but admiration,
the wish to share, and communicate.
While we all know some English,
there is a lot those two have to say to each other.
One dreams about rebuilding the United States,
as The United States of The World.
The Other wants to look into every corner,
to be certain that mis-education is eating the world.
There cannot be dislikes here,
only Love and Understanding, in Wisdom.
Wisdom calls to Love,
Everywhere.
Without wisdom a Police officer will unravel into a thug,
with wisdom, disobey orders and protect those who fight for goodness.
Without wisdom, children made to become soldiers, will kill each other,
with wisdom, they will turn right around and look their fathers, and commanders in the eyes.
Without wisdom politicians will fuel tensions among the nations of the world,
with wisdom, they will immediately dismantle nuclear weapons and ban war, not just unethical weapons.
Without wisdom religious leaders divide the world and create open wounds that will never heal,
in wisdom, they will rise up against human rights violations and become popularizes of science and reason.
Without wisdom leaders will see criminals as &quot;needing to be brought to heel&quot;,
with wisdom, they will see children who never had a real chance at the good life.
Without wisdom, agencies claiming to protect nations will subvert democracy and destroy the nations they were sworn to protect,
with wisdom, they will respectfully prevent the unwise from gaining access to or remaining in positions of authority.
Without wisdom, Earth will be brought to a crisis that will cause mass starvation and call for population control,
with wisdom, businesses that contribute to the Anthropocene Extinction will have to close as profits have no meaning in a world without a future.
Without wisdom, governments will be blind to poverty and prevent generations of children from growing up,
with wisdom, money will be used to help people not erase their minds.
Without wisdom, broken children will become broken men and in poverty of mind parade the color of their skin, or hair as a sign of superiority,
with wisdom we will admire our beautiful uniqueness the wy we admire the colors of each others eyes.
The word Philosophy comes from Greek,
it means Love of Wisdom.
All wisdom is the same,
there is no bad wisdom, or good wisdom, just Universal wisdom.
Wisdom is special,
it is like an operating system.
Unlike a computer operating system,
wisdom independently emerges in sufficiently educated individual beings.
It is something that we are predisposed for, by Nature,
Wisdom is the next big step that Humanity must take.
Ineffective Education, and Education driven by propaganda or fantasies,
is hurting our progress forward.
Our education is a very delicate process,
fear of being held back, or bad grades, or being taught fairy tales or falsehoods delays our progress.
Poverty, homelessness, hunger, self medication, and violence,
prevents us from learning, and we cannot make out way towards wisdom in that state.
We have to protect the children from our lack of wisdom,
and help them to understand that the only way they can have a future is by means of Wisdom and the Love it entails.
We have to encourage children to become Great Beings,
and we have to admit that we can&apos;t fix the world because it is a multi-generational project.
The repairs that are required rely on increased levels of Honest and Real Education throughout the world,
no more noise, no more haste, no more grades or levels or division that render subjects incomprehensible.
A real school is marked by real results,
by helping all their students towards Real Wisdom onward to helping them become Great Beings.
Today, very few graduates can see value in retaking all exams that helped them graduate,
and fewer still would be able to get the grades that prove that school was effective.
We confuse our amazing ability to learn, with school&apos;s ability to teach,
and we suffer for it, most of us are tricked into thinking that we aren&apos;t that smart, but the truth is that the school isn&apos;t that good.
Do not let schools trick you away from Wisdom,
we are an important link in a chain that connect past to the future, we must aim to become wise and teach wisdom as the highest value.
The world will stand still when divided,
when united in wisdom we will rise.</span>

you are not the only one to care.
There are others that will fight beside you,
so as long as your cause is just and true.
Some will fight by subtle analogy,
learn from them, and their lack of apology.
Speaking out will set you free,
even though many will come to disagree.
Our lives are unfortunately much too short,
but good things will come and you&apos;ll find comfort.
We are afforded a handful of miracles,
and those certainly will aid to your cause.
Most importantly remember to just speak out,
the change is up to the people that you bring about.
Your voice is one but a million is required,
so only speak, and never go past getting tired.
Whatever it is that you will say,
do not forget about Love not even for a day.
Personal Note,
I seem to babble on about many things,
but the first wrong that hurt me was school.
So when I think about helping the world grow,
the first thing that comes to mind is fixing it.
I am really worried about the ease,
with which we can be indoctrinated into false beliefs.
I mean we are all born into a world
with intercontinental ballistic missiles pointed at all cities.
We accept this all to easily,
most of us never pays any attention.
The mechanism behind our blind acceptance.
is also the same mechanism that may launch them someday.
To really see all the things we need to fix,
we have to wiggle ourselves out of any and all indoctrinations.
One of our most powerful superpowers,
is thinking by subtle analogy to something else.
That is one of the mechanisms that powers our wisdom,
we can see or solve problems based on other things we find in books.
There are three people that influenced my ideas about education the most,
Richard Dawkins, Erica Goldson, and the Saintly Sir Ken Robinson.
When I look at them, I feel like I copied everything from them,
but that&apos;s just means we are all fighting toward similar goals.
The thing that sticks out about me is this notion of wisdom,
I absolutely believe that we are all great thinkers that eventually become wise.
And unlike Sir Robinson who urges to reform,
or Miss Godson who want to work together.
I mostly want to encourage students to stop trusting schools,
and accept the responsibility for their own education.
I do not think that being bombarded by mixtures of lessons and homework,
is good for learning, I think it only induces cramming, and renders a student uneducated.
Sir Robinson mentions,
that there is a small percentage of students that do thrive in school.
But you see what Erica Goldson is saying,
she&apos;s is only good at passing tests, and she&apos;s scared.
Richard Dawkins is a scientist who urges people,
to focus on the The Magic of Reality, rather than any other magic.
The way he takes to the stage,
and the way he moves an audience.
His dignity and certainty of knowing-that he is correct,
and that he is helping the world grow, is an perfect example of a Great Being.
The title of this text,
comes from a question asked by a young [presumably religions] lady: &quot;What if you&apos;re wrong?&quot;
I urge you to look it up on the internet to hear his response,
and to see what a being hoping to help the world grow really looks like.
One of the most heartbreakingly powerful things that comes to my mind in regards to his work,
is him visiting a school where children are being indoctrinated into the belief that Noah and his Ark are absolutely real.
These children can&apos;t know otherwise,
it becomes their very reality.

                      <span class="text-muted">You must not allow your parents to use school as a babysitter,
you must not allow your teachers to trick you into memorization.
Friends and social life, are not an excuse to stay in a bad school,
grab your friends and transfer to something better, or learn on your own.
A bad school diploma does not get you anything,
it only shows people that they can cheat you.
On the other hand dumping a broken school,
and transferring to something that does show results makes a world of difference.
For one it will help you experience independence,
with a small measure of discomfort it will help your mind become stronger.
You do not want to work at a company that expect you to waste years on junk lectures,
your years are precious, each year must find you smarter, stronger, and wiser.
Rejection of pretending to learn,
and not following others will help you grow.
Finding lectures or books that do make you smarter and wiser,
will help you build your own company.
Schools are almost certainly completely broken,
they may be so broken that otherwise normal people may need dangerous medications to pass.
You must resist memorization, and merely getting good at passing tests,
because that is not an real education, that&apos;s just basic acting.
It is not enough to be in school,
or even to have good grades.
You must ask yourself if you are learning for real,
and if what you are learning is useful to you.
You must ask yourself if you are seeing real results,
if what you have learned had a positive impact on you.
And, you may not be able to find a school,
it is a real tragedy, we failed you.
Even if &quot;Fake it until you make it&quot;,
has already turned the world into a brittle cheeto.
There is hope,
the hope is in self-education.
The people who invented schools and those who made breakthroughs in science,
begun their self education with a single thread or a question.
They followed a single unbroken line of curiosities and answers,
start with survey courses in Science and Adventure.
To find your beginning search carefully amongst electronics,
art and sculpture or painting and music, computers, design, programming.
Find the start, get your answers, and rest,
and now resume from where you left off.
No stress here,
no hard work.
You may only need LEGO Technic and a Raspberry PI kit with sensors,
maybe a a book about UNIX and a couple of used cheap 3D printers that you splice together.
The only thing that you have to be mindful of,
is keeping a a small Research Journal and Building a Huge Colorful Portfolio.
In fact your portfolio should become one of the main reasons,
for becoming a Graphic Designer and possibly a Web Developer.
After all, you are capturing your pure joy,
and your path of self-education is pure pride.
This kind of coupling, where the want of a beautiful portfolio,
pushes you towards Design, and possibly programming happens often.
A personal &quot;want&quot; has driven many independent inventors before you,
difference between being taught, and reaching out for knowledge yourself is like night and day.
One takes you to enlightenment, and the other,
often times towards hating Mondays, waiting for Wednesdays and drinking on Fridays while you wonder if you hate your life.
It is likely that you will not be accepted to Harvard, not even Peace Corps,
but listen...
...what does an institution that expects you to sit through worthless mind numbing lectures,
matter to you, and what does that say about their values and ideals, and deans and the friends and experiences you will encounter there.
Don&apos;t bother with things that are not worth your time,
we have to find a way to fix the world.
We have to fix schools, we have to fix poverty,
and damn it, we can&apos;t go through our lives with atomic weapons pointed at our families.
Ideas like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD),
and banning certain weapons in war but not war it self really show us how young of a civilization we are.
Now we race for a High School or College Diploma,
by pretending to learn with memorization while teachers pretend they didn&apos;t force us into it for a paycheck.
And deans pretend they have no idea this is going on,
and for the mere stress of massive unforgivable student debt we can get a brand name education that recruiters will void their bowels over.
Oh, and not to mention the 13th Amendment where we can be sent into Legal Slavery,
by downloading the complete questionable works of Lady Gaga in mp3 format, or even just for participating in IPFS to host our own poems.
There is nothing that you will gain from not learning,
pretending to get educated is just the same as staying uneducated.
Spewing useless gibberish about Trig or powerhouses of the cell,
only makes people look foolish.
Not only that, but eventually they figure out they got tricked into cramming,
and now not only the look foolish - but heartbreakingly - start feeling it too.
For those of you who did get tricked,
please just listen to top rated Audio Books in the science, adventure, philosophy and memoir section, it won&apos;t take long to catch up.
That whole thing about not being able to learn fast because you are older is fake,
as you get older your bullshit meters get better.
It is just that you are no longer willing to waste your time on useless things,
that&apos;s why books work but re-taking the GED does not.
But do take it easy,
especially when you are young.
Learn to avoid troublemakers,
they are just children with aged faces.
And no there are no exceptions,
and no you are not meant to fill in the blanks for them.
The last thing you need is your husband deciding to smoke weed or become a drunk (or worse) 15 years into a marriage because it is now legal,
there is no excuse, no shortcuts in the world of lack of education, we neeeeeeeed wisdom, it is our operating system, it is our everything.
Our minds are so powerful,
it is so easy to inherit from memoirs.
When combining fascinating books with incredible adventures...
when you find your self atop of an ancient dune in the middle of a nasty storm listening to a life changing book, it all becomes clear.
You are underestimating yourself,
most of us have no idea how powerful we are.
Our only problem is that in the face of not knowing,
we can be easily mislead and follow useless paths for years or even decades, such as is the case with ineffective education.
So speak out,
don&apos;t follow, and don&apos;t be silent.
With the aid of your classroom friends,
make it clear to your teacher that you would rather study things that are relevant to you-personally, that enlighten your path and produce lasting results that you can build on.
Read books, begin your self education, and develop the skills necessary to express your concerns about the school just turning you into profits,
fill an auditorium, give speeches and talks in multiple schools; become a leader, an inspiration, a Great Being.
Do Not Follow,
Life Is Too Precious, and Your Wisdom Too Important.

                      <span class="text-muted">Surely, this is a very mild winter season,
and Spring will come a month sooner just for that reason.
Therefore, we are really just about 84 days away,
it is coming real fast even though today the sky was gray.
And since this was an extremely warm year,
we can be certain that Spring really is near.
I&apos;d say we are looking at just about 54 days in total,
and this is hard evidence, not at all, anecdotal.
But you know, as well as I do too,
that this Spring will be a meteorological breakthrough.
So all in total, give or take a day,
I think Spring is just about 24 days away.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">The best way to win against a liar, is to never meet one,
the simplest way to &quot;win&quot; is not to play their game.
This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,
liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.
One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,
they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn&apos;t cause much headache.
But it, looking like an expensive medicine, and costing like one,
when people felt it in their system, they automatically assumed it was working.
This is still going on, and when I was a teenager I actually bought a skin cleanser,
at a pharmacy, in the US, that in no uncertain terms, stated that this was homeopathic medicine,
Home and medicine, sounded good to me,
and it seemed to have been a gentle soap, but it was just the cheapest thing that they could possibly put in a tube.
I checked the top three pharmacies in the US in 2020, and heart-breakingly,
they all continue selling homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
Knowledge and Wisdom, and the path it entails,
is the most wonderful and safest way to avoid all this nonsense.
Because once you become more knowledgeable than the liar,
you will be able to hear them bending words, and twisting stories, the way your Mum was able to pick up on subtle cues when you were lying as a baby.
Now, past some point in an education, many, or perhaps most people, front healthy skepticism first,
not because they assume everyone is a liar, but because they wonder if someone might not have tricked themselves into a falsehood like I did with my homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
More than that, when I was a teenager, and someone asked me if Mokele-mbembe existed,
I would whole heatedly, and with all the love in my heart, say:
&quot;I hope so, after all, it is not a question of their existence, is it now? They used to exist millions of years ago.
It is a question of whether or not there is one or two, left in Rhodesia.&quot; - with a heavy and hairy accent, whilst bouncing my unibrow up an down.
Anybody asking me about cryptozoology was better off,
fronting mountains of skepticism first - the brontosaurus was my favorite dinosaur!
And get this, Brontosaurus is no longer the same thunder lizard we are all familiar with,
it was a misclassification, the dinosaur that you think of as Brontosaurus is actually called Apatosaurus now.
In context of liars, which are pretty damn scary, and only get more frightening as they come together in groups,
...searching for forgiveness, reinforcement and easy pickings to whatever their disorder is; we need to take to knowledge and wisdom as soon as possible.
Middle school, is a pretty good time to start learning for real,
and start climbing over everyone&apos;s heads, to get ahead of things.
Books narrated by their authors,
are an especially precious gift of knowledge.
Bill Bryson has some nice and funny books that help people grow,
A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, and In a Sunburned Country, are beautiful.
But it is best that you start with what moves you,
look at various best seller lists, and keep an eye on non-fiction of you can.
And climb, keep searching for that next book that will agree with you,
and explore everything, explore the world, the trails, the libraries, all the places of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.
It does not take many books to get ahead of liars,
it only takes a few more to get ahead of those that don&apos;t know they are causing harm.
And here the handful of your beloved Memoirs, Biographies, and adventure books,
will transform, to your Sword and Shield, and you will fell many a monster and dragon, onward to a cheerful future.
Start learning on your own, not just to avoid liars and crappy people,
but to become you, the person that you are predisposed to be.
As you grow, there will be some mild regrets, but it is not going to be anything huge,
and whatever you do end up missing by taking your own less traveled road...
Use is as a compass, just because you missed something, it doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t find it again,
feeling like you missed something is a beautiful call to new adventure.
There is nothing to be scared of, by choosing the path of Knowledge, Wisdom, and maybe Greatness,
those are the very components by which humanity grows.
Our superpowers that grant us the abilities to prevent suffering.
making our pains count for more by fixing the problems that hurt us, and preventing others from falling into the same trap.

                    <span class="text-muted">The Universe works in very honest ways,
when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.
When we face impossible problems,
someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.
When governments become too complex,
the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.
When liars start winning all the battles,
your wisdom will become even more precious.
A senator&apos;s boy brought into positions of authority,
by means of favors, shortcuts, and being told what to say, can&apos;t become wise.
Wisdom grows from within our authenticity, dignity, and love,
from clarity of vision, and being moved by generations of giants.
Authenticity helps us up,
wisdom on top of wisdom, plateau by plateau onward to greatness.
Inauthenticity, can only build temporary things,
that soon collapse under their own weight for lack of foundation.
Just because you feel hopelessness,
when you dream about making the world a better place...
It does not mean you should stop loving, thinking, writing,
when the future comes asking: what is next?
Your books are to be complete, beloved, and held in high esteem,
your works must move the world.
All that is true, and worthy of human kind,
requires generations of work, same inspiration, same vision.
May your works serve as the first stepping stone,
a source of rules that will keep Humanity Safe and Sound.
May your works inspire countless generations,
across all the world&apos;s nations.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">We have a tendency to take things for granted,
and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.
It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.
The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.
Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.
The world has also become more interconnected,
those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.
Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,
all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.
There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,
the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.
All the fantasies and walls will fade, today&apos;s problem with borders and cults,
is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,
to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.
We are infinite in our minds,
just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.
Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,
something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.
It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,
and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.
This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,
this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.
And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,
the sciences call to everyone.
Personalized education doesn&apos;t really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,
as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.
Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,
and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.
We don&apos;t learn the way schools teach,
we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.
By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,
problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.
A more knowledgeable world,
is a more capable world.</span>
