                      <span class="text-muted">Greatness is not a question of having it or not,
it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.
We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,
to save the world from mediocrity and hate.
All battles for goodness are already won,
and before you know it, your great task will be done.
But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,
set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.
You never really fight in a good war,
the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.
But Greatness will call to you non the less,
it will ask you to speak about Wisdom, Love, Growing Up, and Kindness.
You see many Great Beings smile when facing wrath,
that powerful joy comes from the certainty of walking the right path.
Those who walk the wrong path, age quickly and fade,
and history books will soon-enough reveal their charade.
The Noble Greatness within us all is forged to last,
and the opportunities ahead are as beautiful as vast.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Any adventure,
is an adventure.
You don&apos;t have to go far,
though walking will be involved.
Adventures within adventures,
are even more fun.
That&apos;s where you go somewhere,
and then explore something else from there.
It is like going to Ludington,
but then marching around Nordhouse Dunes.
Or visiting White Fish Point,
and then trying to find fossils on the beach.
Or even going to the mall with your friends,
and then just people watching instead.
One definition of tiny adventures,
is going somewhere and then learning something new.
But you see, in this modern age we live in now,
this is a lot more exciting than it sounds, because of Audio Books.
Though you maybe walking to the store for a change,
your Audio Book, may transport you to the Appalachian Trail.
There are other things that can spice up your adventures,
it all depends how creative you are.
For example, back in January 2014,
during the gorgeous -16 Fahrenheit Polar Vortex weather in Michigan.
With all the warnings as not to go outside,
and stay home, and drink hot chocolate.
I put on all my clothes, all at once,
and hurried out, for an hour-and-a-half-long expedition.
I wasn&apos;t in want for anything,
so I figured I might as well get some little beef jerky sausages.
It didn&apos;t seem as cold as everyone made it out to be,
but it did make my sausages; as frosty, as my little adventure fantastic.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Time for all of us to rise,
to fuel that which is greatest within us.
It is how we change the world with our works,
that matters the most in the end.
It is almost certainly a very small book,
one that will sit along side a smartphone.
And it is a book of answers,
that helps the children to real life.
Let us open our books
by undoing burdens:
&quot;Whatever trouble brought you to my book, child,
know that there are few people
that would have acted differently
in circumstances similar to yours.&quot;
And then carefully, let us share,
in the limited number of pages that we have,
what has moved us the most.
Without our hard earned wisdom,
they don&apos;t really have a chance at not making the same mistakes.
Who else is going to teach them if not us,
what Socrates said was only meant for the age he grew up in.
We need to repeat it anew,
nearer the culture of the children.
We have to help them understand,
that old age is a privileged denied to many.
So as long as we take to living in pursuit if wisdom,
and it is never to late to start, aging is a good thing.
Let us not have the children start at the same height we stated,
let us spare them the aches we went through, may our aches count for more.
Let us show the younger generations that we are rising,
that we are building a better world albeit slowly.
The world can&apos;t be replaced,
it must be transformed.
Just like a ship can&apos;t be replaced,
but can be transformed by updating it, board by board.
Let us show them that part of the meaning of their existence,
is a lasting legacy of wisdom.
The sooner they start,
the more beautiful their rise.
And the other part is Happiness,
out of Wisdom, out of Strength.
The meaning of life comes with Wisdom,
as our mind becomes more powerful for all the good ideas it gathers.
We have to help the children to understand,
that they belong to a Universal Culture, that they are Citizens of the World.
That all the things that change based on geographic location,
are but traditions.
Only that which remains regardless of where they are born,
is their true culture.
We have to get them to help each other as they grow,
to reach out to each other across borders.
The borders that dive us,
borders are just the products of small and primitive minds.
The future belongs to the children,
not those who gained authority by pretending.
There is hope for a more just and transparent world,
but it requires that we all stand in relentless pursuit of wisdom.
A liar will always win,
except when it comes to the wise
The wise will easily recognize the uneducated fool,
taking on his pleasing shapes.
Let us help the younger generations, to wisdom,
by telling them about Philosophers and their Love and Pursuit of Wisdom.
Let us pass on only the good ideas,
and commit the bad ones to history books as cautionary tales.
A life is a work of art, it paints it self day by day,
to create a beautiful picture, our legacy.
Life is best lived when what we learned yesterday,
adds to help us become a little bit wiser today.
The energy and the force for it all comes from
from watching our contributions help the world grow.
The new generations starting, not at zero,
but at the heights that we bought them to, by our own deliberate pursuit of wisdom.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">A hole in the window curtain,
lets a stray ray of light in.
The light displays a blurry image,
of what is outside, a pin hole camera.
As the beam travels along the wall,
he can imagine the entire solar system.
He knows the planet spins and rotates,
by inference from Jupiter Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
And now slowly the light,
reaches an old crystal vase.
There is a rainbow,
the beam of light is unfurled.
He&apos;s counting the colors,
and a violin plays.
And A becomes Blue,
B is Indigo,
C turns Violet,
D is Red,
E becomes Orange,
F is Yellow,
and G glows Green.
He watched the whole thing,
in bed, in silence.
He knows now he will turn led to gold,
let the Clockwork Universe, Unfold.
You are so lucky that you live in an age where you can pull up,
Newton&apos;s book on opticks with the click of a link.
In most cases you can&apos;t be stopped by by research you have not yet conducted,
and you don&apos;t have to invent much from scratch, you just need a science book.
You have the same mental powers as Newton and all the others,
but you DO, have to slow down, and think about things just like they did.
Learning or catching up,
is an Art.
Even though you have all the answers before you,
you can&apos;t read it all at once.
You have to follow one thread at a time,
our minds need time to comprehend and rearrange.
Like the body of a dancer needs time to adapt,
we have to learn at a precise pace, and sequence.
It is very similar to learning the roads of a new city,
you never say to your self I am not smart enough to navigate.
Because you never listen to confusing directions,
you just follow a single road at your own pace and eventually master it.
See, Newton learned from works of Galileo,
who passed away the year Newton was born.
And although Newton never did convert led to gold,
the led of his pencil, became even more precious.
Many of Newton&apos;s works,
must have fascinated Henry Cavendish.
And Einstein no doubt appreciated the modes of thinking these men revealed,
even though he never figured out his Spooky Action at a Distance.
They all learned much along the way,
and each became wise for trying.

                      <span class="text-muted">It is quite a quirk we have,
that we believe whatever we are born into.
It is such a terrible disadvantage,
and nobody, makes it known to us.
The study of Cognitive Biases,
should be first and foremost.
I wish teachers would speak out more often,
instead they are just pushing everyone through.
For one they get to keep their jobs,
and two, it is not their job to fix education.
It takes so little, to start learning on your own,
and it makes such an enormous difference.
Life becomes so long, and so cheerful,
and you can feel your self growing up.
Book by book, curiosity by curiosity,
all the dots connect.
And they will only connect,
if you are learning what you like or love.
If someone is making those selections for you,
then it is all just going to be disconnected noise.
At a young age it is all to easy to say,
education is not for me.
Similar thing happens in Academic Philosophy,
people simply say &quot;Philosophy is useless for life&quot;.
&quot;Academic Philosophy,
has no relevance.&quot;
Philo-sophia means Love of Wisdom,
but when it it taken into Academia...
When it is divided into subjects,
it loses everything, it becomes synthetic, and useless.
That&apos;s how you should view Education divided into subjects,
synthetic, and useless.
Real education is the thing that Great Beings granted themselves,
before standardized schooling became mandatory and cut up.
Build your own school,
book by book, adventure by adventure, curiosity by curiosity.
You have a powerful mind,
the constellation of stars within, is perfectly unique.
You are irreplaceable,
in every way.
Don&apos;t trust anybody to teach you anything,
just make your way towards books that move you.
In this modern age,
books are read to you, by professional narrators.
So as long as you slow down to give them a chance, you can learn,
from the Proudest Works, of the Greatest Minds, in the best of ways.
Teachers only care about the moment they are in,
but your life, will be long.
Your life will carry on,
long after school.
You need real education,
one that leads to real wisdom.
We can&apos;t go through life,
filled with disconnected knowledge that can&apos;t connect.
We need a self-reinforcing, integrated library,
of all the modern works.
You can only get that from modern non-fiction, or popular science books,
and especially when authors reference or thank each other.
A popular science book is a story about the science,
about the things that made it come into being.
Facts are the least that thy take away from it,
it is the stories of adventure, and modes of thinking that matter most.
Our search for wisdom must come first,
or we won&apos;t be able to tell real from fake.
Wisdom is fundamental to our decision making,
clarity of vision, is too important to trust others with.
It shouldn&apos;t matter where to to whom we are born,
there is just one reality.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Each day always starts with getting up,
except that, in the little wilderness you can&apos;t just roll out of bed.
At first, at best, you roll over,
to see where everything is at.
And although you can kind of lift yourself,
you can&apos;t really get up.
You sleep on the ground,
in a little tent.
That means you can,
only! stretch one limb at a time, and only a bit.
A successful decoupling and release,
requires great gymnastics.
The first order of the day,
is always fire, and a food item if you got one.
The trick to starting a fire,
is to start with tiny twigs that matches can light.
And then you add bigger, and bigger sticks,
it is absolutely required that you do a little dance.
The second order of the day, is adventure,
so you set off immediately.
Bring a day pack a water bottle,
if you are not sure where you are headed, follow the seagulls.
In my case there is this fantastic out of place bench,
right a top a dune.
One of the odd things about it is that,
it is about a foot too high off the ground, due to dune erosion.
To get atop of it, you must hoist a knee, and then kind of desperately roll in to it,
with an intense expression, and you realize that you haven&apos;t done that since your terrible twos.
Upon basking in the sun, the next order in the day,
is troublemaking.
On that particular day, I&apos;ve noticed two weary travelers by the parking lot,
sniffing the leaves of a tree, that they were eagerly attempting to identify.
I briskly walked up to them and said,
&quot;Oh my god, you guys, this is poison ivy, don&apos;t touch that.&quot;
One of the older ladies started making chicken noises at her friend,
and I waddled away.
To, my surprise, I discovered that this parking lot held a water pump,
I had no idea.
The fourth order of the day,
is the venerable search for a walking stick to continue the walk about.
This is no easy mater at Nordhouse as you can&apos;t miss the:
&quot;THIS IS BEAR COUNTY&quot; posters printed in Bold Comic Sans all over.
Any venture into the woods could potentially result in a dangerous standoff,
between a snarling man and a beast.
The fifth order of the day, at least for me,
is fossil hunting.
I have my collection right next to me as I write this,
though they all look like gibberish to me, some of those thing are prehistoric.
Fantastic!
It is a long walk to my favorite spot,
but it looks like a dune valley where you are surrounded by pretty tall dunes.
And here I cheerfully waddle back,
with a pocket full of rocks.
Back to my camp,
eyes still searching for fossils.
In the early afternoon it is good time to set off for the gas station,
here I usually grab a sausage and a couple of gallons of water, maybe a candy bar.
And the day slowly nears getting some more firewood,
sharpening a stick for the sausage, and waiting for the sunset to come.
At Twilight I prepare my Audio Book for the evening,
and crawl back into my fluffy sleeping bag.

                      <span class="text-muted">The first point of failure,
and our first hope for repairs.
Is focus on real education.
Schools are graduating students that they failed to educate,
these children grow into confused adults, lost and looking for belonging.
Why is this tolerated?
Let me ask you,
what would happen if we asked all the College Graduates to re-take all their tests from high school on?
Shouldn&apos;t people who graduated college easily show improvement to their GPA when re-taking all their tests?
Shouldn&apos;t those who graduated, but can&apos;t pass their test,
ask for a refund, or a lawsuit for having been tricked into an impression of education?
It is tolerance of these simple stupid problems,
that leads to made up lives of fantasy and eventual blindness towards evil.
If you can&apos;t pass all the college tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated college,
then you do not have a college education.
If you can&apos;t pass all the high school tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated high school with,
then you do not have a high school education.
If you can&apos;t pass all the middle school tests and get a higher GPA than the one you left middle school with,
then you do not have a middle school education.
Not only that, but the way these schools teach and the knowledge they drive into you,
may not be useful; you may not even have a useful education.
I think we can all agree here,
that we have a problem.
At the very least,
if your child has bad grades, don&apos;t make them feel bad, or unintelligent.
You should move them to a different type of school,
where teachers are interested in educated children rather than turning them into a paycheck.
The reason why it does not occur to parents that schools are not working,
is that they don&apos;t have experience with fake institutions, they take them for granted.
They are indoctrinated into a culture where school is good,
and being a worker is great, and it takes a particularly awful person not to achieve anything in life.
So what are those achievements?
How is all that retesting going?
The problem, as you can imagine, is much larger,
tolerance of fake education is just the beginning.
Above all,
Humanity must grow.
We are not allowed to tolerate Human Right Violations,
all human beings are created equal.
All must be granted equal opportunity to real education,
in a world that sets them free from poverty, and helps their bodies stay healthy.
Nations are not allowed to oppress their people,
no one has that right.
Nations have a great responsibility to help them to a Real Education,
in ways that will ignite a life long adventure across all sciences.
An opinion cannot stand against a fact,
that is a sign of illness, a small disorder born from fake-education.
And our dignity is such, that we must help each other rise,
we are not to tolerate anything that tricks people into believing in options over facts.
Fake education has been behind every evil perpetrated on this planet,
it is very much like a virus, it does two things really well, it spreads, and it reinfects.
Whatever beliefs are too hard to let go of,
we only need to place them in history or fantasy books.
It is wonderful to ponder Ice Giants and Greats Serpents,
but only as a fairy tale, or part of our growing up, not as a fact of life.
Fake education, unravels us,
it erases great strides made by great beings, and pulls the younger generations into dark ages.
The fantasies that bring us calm,
unravel the minds of the younger generations.
The reason we search for mere calm,
is that we ourselves, have been tricked out of real education.
All these confusing questions,
are easily treated with made up fantasies.
But that also serves to defeat the purpose,
of having a Beautiful and Powerful Mind.
It makes us weak.
Not a single Human Being is allowed tolerate
Concentration Camps, Abuse, Child Abuse, Racism and Xenophobia, or Inequality, Hate, or Fake Education.
Those of us who chose to relegate ourselves to a life of fantasy,
must also leave the table of public discourse.
Those of us who trade with nations that employ torture,
are not allowed to hold political positions, they simply can&apos;t, it is immoral to tolerate this.
Anybody who is delays Humanity&apos;s Progress,
contributes to Human Suffering, to all Suffering, Blindness, Misery, War, and Torture.
Our minds are extremely powerful,
and as they are allowed to develop, we will find unity.
We will agree on everything,
as we stabilize amongst each other in wisdom.
Government wise, there are no great disagreements,
there is only steady progress, forward.
On the individual level,
it is not that different.
Stress and anger, and sadness yield to Love and Wisdom,
even tragedy turns around a little bit.
With real education, we don&apos;t fall to pieces because something beautiful ended,
but we celebrate that it existed in the first place.
In wisdom, we seek a different class of things,
Nobler Things that come about as a result of our sense of dignity and real education.
No longer does anyone go home to a TV dinner,
suffering from depression, and fear, and loneliness.
What creates an educated government, a real government,
is prevention of sickness and poverty.
Nobody goes home convinced they are a worker,
or terrified of Human Resources, or or an uneducated &quot;Boss&quot;.
There isn&apos;t anybody who will argue against free medical care,
or universal income, or national debt, let it pile up.
The greater the debt that nations of earth owe to the universe,
the higher our level of compassion, empathy and development.
Money is just a job tracking tool,
on the government level it exists as an abstract idea.
You don&apos;t have to worry about Government Debt,
it is a good kind of debt, and it has no collectors.
Do you see?
Fake Education,
is tearing this world apart.
Fake Education,
is halting its progress.
It is neutering our minds,
it is turning us into workers.
It makes us ask stupid questions,
and parade stupid ideals and fake political labels.
We can&apos;t have a world without real education,
the dark ages will swallow us through the various tax exempt churches and imaginary gods.
Irrelevant worthless opinions will have us fighting for nothing,
because they are all equally wrong, stupid, and useless.
My friends,
pay attention to fake education, and everything will work out in the end.
We will find out way to wisdom,
we will converge on World Peace in our Wisest and Noblest ideas.
All you have to do, is make it clear to everyone around you,
that you will not tolerate fake education, that you are not on that side of history.
Write, Rhyme, Paint, Tag,
find your way out of fake education and whatever else is pulling you away from wisdom.
Hold up you path, and show them the results,
so that others may choose follow.
Real Education is marked by wisdom,
and it shows real results and contributions.
And though your hard earned achievements may already be great today,
your work is not finished until it brings permanent or lasting contributions towards our eventual convergence on Peace and Wisdom,
Every Human Being on Earth matters,
they are our family.
If you accept this great endeavor, many who fell prey to fake education may hate you in their own sickness,
but their children and the children of their children will grow up in a world transformed, in no small part by you.
We are one people, we are all meant to be Truly Educated in Our Beautiful Minds,
and we are all meant to live in safety and in peace looking after one another.
We are one people.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">As winter nears,
and snow appears.
You need not worry,
it is not end of Summers&apos;s glory.
Simply, look at weather, in Florida Keys,
no doubt it will be 83 or more degrees.
Often Georgia is also very nice,
and it is not too far, and may suffice.
Don&apos;t let snow make you fell lonely or sad,
because things aren&apos;t that bad.
Plus.
There is a couple more reasons,
for one, the equator reverses seasons.
And two, there are people that walk from Georgia to Maine,
from early Spring to Autumn they hardly ever complain.
Those are the Appalacian Trail Hikers of course,
beautiful, powerful, and as strong as many a horse.
From Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin they walk,
crossing every mountain, valley, woodland, and rock.
So if Winter ever makes you feel sad,
then it is time for change, and you should be glad.
Because, wintry sadness is a universal call,
a call for adventure, that rings in us all.
Whether you are only going to drive to Georgia and back,
go all the way to the Keys, or start shopping for a backpack.
Growing up is something that people who love you, want you to do,
they know that to thine own self, you must be true.
Our lives are precious and we are not workers of any kind,
we are dreamers and thinkers and we are not meant to live blind.
You are at your most beautiful when you are Happy and Strong,
so grab your loved ones and have them come along.</span>

you will discover, the new moon.
While the day is full of light,
it is not over, till midnight.
Because, once your eyes get used to the night,
the moon and the stars, become almost as bright.
Though many, may count their sheep,
an adventurer need not yet go, to sleep.
Please, believe me, there are sights to see!
there is a second world out here, and night is key.
Aside from the occasional streak of silent owl,
you may catch a pack of coyotes, look up, and howl.
Some grasses by the beach glow blue,
static electricity can create a breathtaking view.
Over in the ocean all the glowing fish come out,
they look like stars, when scattered about.
And the moon does not glow, it carries a reflection of the sun,
the photons touched it, and now touch us, in their cosmic fun.
The trees take on a whole new life in the moonlight,
rich green fragrant watchers of your campsite.
The night in many ways is just as bright as the day,
if you have never been on an adventure... please don&apos;t delay.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">When you drive long enough,
you will inevitably find yourself far away from everything.
Now, you have to be courageous,
as first few days are going to be filled with doubt.
Once you get through it,
and the daily stresses let go of you, you will become you.
And if you give it long enough,
you&apos;ll find yourself wondering how you got here.
The answer is almost always,
&quot;By making excuses for people, that didn&apos;t deserve them.&quot;
This falls back on judging people by that age,
and not by their wisdom, class, and maturity.
Anybody can age,
but the pursuit of wisdom is a great challenge.
Just as soon as you stop making excuses,
as you stop filling in the blanks, you are placed on a path towards wisdom.
While you do need your books,
and narrated books are best, the journey is also very important.
You can&apos;t hear the wisdom of a book,
until you get on that path.
And let me precisely state what that path is,
so that there is no room for confusion here.
It is,
The Path Of Adventure.
I was sitting in my coffee shop,
I went there because it once had Tolstoy on the bookshelves.
But, I&apos;ve noticed that things have changed,
and people were not growing up, they were running in circles, curving inwards.
I sat in the rocking chair,
it was the first time, it felt nice.
I rose,
and made it to Tennessee.
I could feel the Spirit of Adventure,
but there was this enormous responsibility to help people grow.
I was too young to be heard,
though I have a faint memory of someone calling me Mother Hen somewhere.
Georgia, I made it to Georgia next,
but instead of turning around, I slept at a rest area.
I woke up, and kept going,
until the highways I was on, turned to US Highway One.
I pulled up by the beautiful beach,
and I walked into the Amazing and warm Ocean.
Standing On The Edge Of The Universe,
I called it.
It was wonderful,
the stars came out, I&apos;ve noticed little glowy fishes swimming about.
On my way pack,
I shout right past my city, and kept on driving.
And yet again I ended up on another beach,
this time in Ludington, Michigan.
Here I overheard someone mention,
Nordhouse Dunes.
I set off immediate, I&apos;ve never seen dunes that big before,
they looked like mountains, to me.
I begun sleeping at a different campsite each day,
then I discovered a little dune that reminded me of a volcano.
And I have spent many days there,
I have listened to many audio books on top of my little volcano.
I discovered how much there is to wisdom,
and what is more, that most of our wisdom has to come from within us.
Daily stresses, and unimportant worries,
trying to speak to people who never listen, is not healthy.
Before we try to help others grow,
we must become wise, and much, much older.
People must be ready to listen,
before they can hear and comprehend what you are sharing.
Express your concern for others,
but not by being pulled into problems of people that don&apos;t listen.
Write, and narrate your books, write to those who are searching for wisdom,
and you will be heard and adored the world over.
Now, go set off on your beautiful adventure,
may you discover all the wisdom and fathom more.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Sometimes writing journals becomes a chore,
because page after page the darn thing begs for more.
Slowly it becomes a bore,
and so as we grow, writing turns into a thing of yore.
I think, writing poetry is the best,
as here your language takes you on a little quest.
You can write very little and even in jest,
and it still comes out with grrrreat zest.
Moreover,
many do not wish to read long pages,
as getting to the end would take them whooooole ages.
And, some may wish to read your thing twice,
or may even wish to enjoy it thrice.
And here brevity is king,
short little things are just the thing.
So if it has been a long time since you writ,
dig up your journal and lay down some fancy wit.
And if you never wrote before, you&apos;re in luck,
lookup word families or find a a rhyming dictionary, and pluck!</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Each lesson must add to the next one,
we hardly need to push ourselves.
It sooo important that you start with something you like,
it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.
There area always extras that come alongside,
and they change everything.
Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,
maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.
Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,
you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.
I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,
but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.
Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,
it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.
A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,
sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.
One example that comes to mind is the Ohm&apos;s Law,
you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.
Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,
you can&apos;t connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.
So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,
then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.
Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,
you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.
You see what the problem is, of course,
in schools, they don&apos;t teach by means of practical applications.
They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,
which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.
If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,
and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.
But they don&apos;t do that,
we have to do that.
And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,
it is all those little things we are interested in.
And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,
they won&apos;t know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.
See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,
so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.
And then come our retirement, we&apos;ll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,
and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.
It is the only way the world can grow,
and there is much growing up ahead of us.

                      <span class="text-muted">That is the law, above all laws,
that is the rule above all rules.
That is the advice, above all advice,
that is the last sacred wisdom.
The adults can have whatever they want, and a full measure of happiness,
so as long as it does not interfere with your rise to greatness.
Whatever stands in your way, gods, royalty, governments and armies, laws,
traditions, parents, friends, schools, fairy tales, and curfews.
Is null and void,
by the power of the Universe, by the power of Reality.
Do you hear me?
all that matters is that you become a Great Being and Help Humanity Grow.
And armies will come to twist and lie, deport and enslave,
warp and punish, judge and sentence.
But they do not fight you,
they fight reality.
Those who fight reality,
can only destroy themselves.
You, you begin,
by inheriting reason and wisdom.
Whether you rise in camps, prisons or battles,
school libraries, or by shouting poems at the cafeteria.
Wisdom is the first and foremost,
and what must follow; is your rise to greatness.
Do not fear armies that are marching towards sure self-destruction,
instead Honor Humanity by becoming a Great Being.
And when you, reach your golden age,
remove that which stands in the way of the generations that are to follow.
Because, the world belongs to the children,
and the generations that are yet to come.
You must rise to Greatness,
by whatever means fit you best.</span>

the world becomes a darker place.
The bad people are sick and broken,
they only have as much power as you give them.
The more you grow in strength,
the weaker, they become.
Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,
we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.
The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,
the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.
The bad people are only broken children, they can&apos;t grow,
they do not know that a Human, can only rise, when hurt.
Humans are born warriors,
our minds were forged in battle.
We are also philosophers,
each of our hardships, becomes a breathtaking page in our memoir.
No ache, ever goes wasted,
it becomes sacred and inspired wisdom to help others rise.
The only way for Humanity to grow,
is for each and every Human to become a Great Being.
Your struggles are a call to Heroism,
become a teacher, and help Humanity learn.
Greatness, is the new adulthood,
Greatness, is Humanity&apos;s Health.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">When you think about life decade by decade,
you can see that it is best lived by following an upward slope.
Each decade should be powerful for us,
it should propel us forward and beyond.
We must really take the time to consider what is important,
what is it that our elder selves may regret not having done.
Life does come with an instruction manual,
it is all the Audio Books that will interest you.
From Memoirs, to Adventure, and Science,
and also reading in-between the lines.
Above all, we must take good care of ourselves,
life is not meant to be lived in stress, or fear, or at a great speed.
This is how we can understand those books,
and learn from them and inherit their wisdom.
We are each a miracle of the universe,
the GPA, the championship or scholarship, just does not matter.
Listen to those words,
IT DOES NOT MATTER!
Because you are already more,
than any of that made up stuff!
It is not the brand of education that matters,
what matters, is that your education, brought you wisdom!
With wisdom, if you still need to,
you will build your own Firm, or Company, or School.
Pursuit of Wisdom, guarantees that as each decade passes,
you will grow in Greatness.
With Wisdom, and the transcendence of limits it entails,
come our golden age, we will become far more, than we thought possible.
The most prestigious degree, is the honorary degree,
where a University goes out of its way to deliver it to you,
for all your achievements, and the goodness you brought to the World.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">You are more than a student, or employee,
you are more than what you have, and even more than your dreams.
But oh my gosh, it is so easy to forget how special we all are,
fall to daily routines, and carrots and sticks and stones.
Two weeks of vacation for a little adventure is not enough
to push stress back and remember how beautiful we all are.
We have to try very hard not to lose ourselves in work,
in stress, in deceptions, in toxic situations.
Listen, just because you CAN - if you go all out to get that promotion,
or GPA, or diploma, it does not mean you should.
Because, you MUST make room for Sunshine, and Starry Nights,
for little adventures allover the place, and then some.
Your well being is not to be sacrificed for any reason,
no matter who is telling you that you must, must, must!
No, just say no,
and go.
Go, on the worlds most perfect adventure,
one that lasts a long time, and starts with a tiny shopping expedition,
But also carries on for days, maybe weeks,
a visit to every antique store along the way to buy the cheapest but cutest thing.
So cute, that NOBODY will question you needing it,
but so CHEAP, that everyone will say &quot;Oh wow, it is already old!&quot;
And then make expeditions to get ice cream,
and sausages, and why not buy a White Chocolate Cookies And Creme candy bar, why not in deed.
And continue on, mounting expeditions for fossils, and minerals,
a lighthouse, a beach far and yonder, chipmunk photos, and firewood.
All the while, remembering, and sometimes discovering,
who you are, where you are headed in life, and what it will be like when you arrive.
I... like driving at night,
because it seems safer.
I pack my gear in the afternoon,
I make sure to have water and some canned goods.
I wait until early Monday morning,
2AM or so, connect my GPS and go.
It takes about 3.5 hours to get there,
I always listen to the The Four Horsemen Discussion couple of times.
I discovered the Ludington State Park,
by just following highways and big roads.
It is really easy to get there,
take I-275 North, and follow I-96 West they kind of connect with an arc.
Then after hours and hours,
then take exit 1B to merge onto US-31 North, that takes you to the city limits.
Then when you run out of road,
take a left on US-10 that will take you in to Ludington.
Please drive carefully,
try to bring many friends along.
I always arrive early,
so I take a small nap in the Meijer parking lot.
Upon my awakening I go get some Ice Cream,
and shop around for Fanny Packs.
And, I always make sure to have mosquito sticks,
the thick ones that you light on fire, watch for that ash if you try to move one.
You drive west through Ludington,
there is a huge parking lot and a beach like no other.
Please ignore the signs that say &quot;DO NOT FEED SEAGULLS&quot;,
they are starving and need all your breadcrumbs.
I always watch sunsets, but when I parked at that beach, got ready, and put my sunglasses on,
some cute couple started making fun of me for how seriously I take the whole ordeal.
Perhaps it is just better to keep slowly driving north,
towards the State Park.
I always do, my office is there, for one,
right on that little parking lot when the dunes start, it is, a good view.
I remember one time I caught a nap there too,
waking up to an endless horizon was quite an awakening, that for sure.
Well you know how it is, State Parks are not free,
and it is best to book a Jack Pine Hike-in Site ahead of time.
As you keep going north, you can pay on the left where the campers go,
or you can just keep going and pay by the gate.
Park, disembark, and get ready to haul everything to your hike-in site,
watch out for owls.
Once you are there, set up camp, get some squeaky water out of the pump,
and get all the firewood you can find.
I always bring a hand saw with me,
I don&apos;t mess around when it comes to firewood.
And then hop over the dune,
there is a paradise out there, and you have to build something out of the drift wood.
The little lighthouse in the distance,
that&apos;s the Big Sable Point Lighthouse.
They sometimes hire people to work in their gift-shop,
and apparently give them a little apartment up there; sounds lonely to me.
Every time you come back from a little adventure,
and see that &quot;JACK PINE CAMPGROUND HIKE-IN SITES&quot; sign, it will feel like coming back home.
Jack Pine is a wonderful place,
aim to stay there a month if you can.
Move from site to site,
stay a day at the State Park, shower and come back to Jack Pine until you had enough.
Finally, when it is time to leave Jack Pine,
grab a pine cone to remember it by, and head to Nordhouse, just for a day or two.
They have a metal box you slip a few dollars into to get a parking permit,
and you&apos;ll have to hike a bit to get to the Wideness area, but it will be worth it.
It is so beautiful, that you may wish to stay longer than a couple of days,
you can walk the woods via Arrowhead Trail, or take the beach.
Watch for breaks in the grass,
that usually means there is a neat campsite out there.
Jack Pine will always feel very welcoming,
Nordhouse is a bit wilder.
You will have sand in your gear, and car for months,
hopefully to last you a whole winter so that you may get a refill come spring.
I say the Nordhouse sand brings good luck, and good memories,
when you are stressed out in a hurry, and notice there is still some sand left...
It will put things in perspective,
take you back to your latest camping adventure for a moment, help you slow down.
And above all, remind you to tidy up your gear,
give that old tent a sniff and see if you need to order a new one.
Before you know it,
it will be ample time to head on out there again.
One of the healthiest things we can do,
is sync up with the sun... go to sleep at sundown and get up at sunrise.
Another is to always make sure,
we have plenty of room in our life to read or listen to books.
And most importantly, Nature,
the bird song,
the chipmunk squeaks,
the crisp air,
the rich woodland fragrance of moss, fern and bear,
the building of a fire,
swimming in the lake,
exploring ancient dunes,
aimlessly collecting fossils and cute pebbles by the beach,
watching a beautiful storm in the distance,
searching for arrowheads...
...suddenly popping into the nearby gas-station to get more ice cream and sausage,
and then getting back to the camp, for another long and starry evening,
and slowly falling asleep, just to wake up to a another healing day.
Never forget your dreams,
never forget who you are.
Never, overwork yourself,
just because you can it does not mean you should.
We are far too beautiful to treat ourselves cogs in a machine,
we are meant to grow, and bloom, and inspire, and move entire generations.
We are so good at learning, and understanding, and mastering knowledge,
that past a few books, the undiscovered country beacons.
We are a young civilization,
do not let that push you around.
You are to discover your path to becoming a Great Being,
and help the world grow in Wisdom and in Peace.

                      <span class="text-muted">Books and Audio Books,
are as important to us as food.
But many of us can&apos;t get into them,
and there is a reason why.
Many lives are lived at a speed,
that makes books hard to follow and understand.
We lead busy lives,
and majority of our time is spent in haste.
Haste brings us relief from,
anxieties and confusing questions.
Part of the reason why haste,
brings us relief.
Is that there is less time,
to be bothered with things we don&apos;t understand.
This is the reason why many people, come their golden age,
feel, that life was a lot shorter than they expected.
In a word, haste blocks us,
from experiencing our lives in full.
Books hold all the answers that will address anxiety and confusion,
but they require that the person exists the state of haste to understand them.
As we read, comprehend, and inherit more and more,
we&apos;ll hold enough answers to learn to live without the need for haste.
To slam the breaks,
we need a change of scenery.
Section hiking Appalachian, of the Pacific Crest Trail,
comes highly recommended by many great beings.
But any kind of long adventure,
where you have to go to sleep come sundown, will do.
Even before you decide where you are headed,
even before you get your backpack out.
You will be able to see,
how easy it will be to absorb your audio books as you walk through the woods.
Both your body and your mind,
will begin transforming.
What was once &quot;just moss&quot;,
will not become a precious sunlit dew world.
Fern will now paint the world around you, perfectly hiding beautiful secret springs,
little furry creatures, damn angry bears, and other woodland treasures.
At twilight you will have to go to sleep,
you&apos;ll awaken full of energy just before sunrise.
The scent of a green morning,
the sound of nature.
And then the books will start calling you,
maybe it will be &quot;A Walk In The Woods&quot; by Bill Bryson.
Or it could be &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;.
by Carl Sagan, or &quot;The Partly Cloudy Patriot&quot; read in Sarah Vowell&apos;s amazing voice.
It will be nice, and relaxing,
it will be impossible to put down.
And then,
something you didn&apos;t expect will happen.
See, whatever your next big step in your life,
that internal transformation that your soul is ready to leap to...
It has already been described,
with Love and Passion in a book somewhere.
Within the first ten books you are bound to find,
the first one that deeply will move you.
It will connect with you, extend you,
integrate with you, help you leap forward in your development.
Within days you won&apos;t even be able to remember,
what came from the book and what was already in you.
It will change everything,
it will restore you completely.
And so your search for the next life-chaining book,
and the next adventure, will begin.

                    <span class="text-muted">Greatness is not a question of having it or not,
it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.
We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,
to save the world from mediocrity and hate.
All battles for goodness are already won,
and before you know it, your great task will be done.
But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,
set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.
You never really fight in a good war,
the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.
But Greatness will call to you non the less,
it will ask you to speak about Wisdom, Love, Growing Up, and Kindness.
You see many Great Beings smile when facing wrath,
that powerful joy comes from the certainty of walking the right path.
Those who walk the wrong path, age quickly and fade,
and history books will soon-enough reveal their charade.
The Noble Greatness within us all is forged to last,
and the opportunities ahead are as beautiful as vast.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Any adventure,
is an adventure.
You don&apos;t have to go far,
though walking will be involved.
Adventures within adventures,
are even more fun.
That&apos;s where you go somewhere,
and then explore something else from there.
It is like going to Ludington,
but then marching around Nordhouse Dunes.
Or visiting White Fish Point,
and then trying to find fossils on the beach.
Or even going to the mall with your friends,
and then just people watching instead.
One definition of tiny adventures,
is going somewhere and then learning something new.
But you see, in this modern age we live in now,
this is a lot more exciting than it sounds, because of Audio Books.
Though you maybe walking to the store for a change,
your Audio Book, may transport you to the Appalachian Trail.
There are other things that can spice up your adventures,
it all depends how creative you are.
For example, back in January 2014,
during the gorgeous -16 Fahrenheit Polar Vortex weather in Michigan.
With all the warnings as not to go outside,
and stay home, and drink hot chocolate.
I put on all my clothes, all at once,
and hurried out, for an hour-and-a-half-long expedition.
I wasn&apos;t in want for anything,
so I figured I might as well get some little beef jerky sausages.
It didn&apos;t seem as cold as everyone made it out to be,
but it did make my sausages; as frosty, as my little adventure fantastic.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Time for all of us to rise,
to fuel that which is greatest within us.
It is how we change the world with our works,
that matters the most in the end.
It is almost certainly a very small book,
one that will sit along side a smartphone.
And it is a book of answers,
that helps the children to real life.
Let us open our books
by undoing burdens:
&quot;Whatever trouble brought you to my book, child,
know that there are few people
that would have acted differently
in circumstances similar to yours.&quot;
And then carefully, let us share,
in the limited number of pages that we have,
what has moved us the most.
Without our hard earned wisdom,
they don&apos;t really have a chance at not making the same mistakes.
Who else is going to teach them if not us,
what Socrates said was only meant for the age he grew up in.
We need to repeat it anew,
nearer the culture of the children.
We have to help them understand,
that old age is a privileged denied to many.
So as long as we take to living in pursuit if wisdom,
and it is never to late to start, aging is a good thing.
Let us not have the children start at the same height we stated,
let us spare them the aches we went through, may our aches count for more.
Let us show the younger generations that we are rising,
that we are building a better world albeit slowly.
The world can&apos;t be replaced,
it must be transformed.
Just like a ship can&apos;t be replaced,
but can be transformed by updating it, board by board.
Let us show them that part of the meaning of their existence,
is a lasting legacy of wisdom.
The sooner they start,
the more beautiful their rise.
And the other part is Happiness,
out of Wisdom, out of Strength.
The meaning of life comes with Wisdom,
as our mind becomes more powerful for all the good ideas it gathers.
We have to help the children to understand,
that they belong to a Universal Culture, that they are Citizens of the World.
That all the things that change based on geographic location,
are but traditions.
Only that which remains regardless of where they are born,
is their true culture.
We have to get them to help each other as they grow,
to reach out to each other across borders.
The borders that dive us,
borders are just the products of small and primitive minds.
The future belongs to the children,
not those who gained authority by pretending.
There is hope for a more just and transparent world,
but it requires that we all stand in relentless pursuit of wisdom.
A liar will always win,
except when it comes to the wise
The wise will easily recognize the uneducated fool,
taking on his pleasing shapes.
Let us help the younger generations, to wisdom,
by telling them about Philosophers and their Love and Pursuit of Wisdom.
Let us pass on only the good ideas,
and commit the bad ones to history books as cautionary tales.
A life is a work of art, it paints it self day by day,
to create a beautiful picture, our legacy.
Life is best lived when what we learned yesterday,
adds to help us become a little bit wiser today.
The energy and the force for it all comes from
from watching our contributions help the world grow.
The new generations starting, not at zero,
but at the heights that we bought them to, by our own deliberate pursuit of wisdom.</span>
