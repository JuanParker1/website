                      <span class="text-muted">Each human being contains precisely one labyrinth mostly consisting of a single long winding road with plenty of forks.
this is their own perfect, private, personal, sacred curriculum.
If they are granted the opportunity to follow it,
at their own pace, in their own way, they will eventually become Wise.
This wondrous road, must double as a library,
and it can only contain Humanity&apos;s Noblest Works of Knowledge and Wisdom.
The men who created, and rebuilt, and mixed up, and reformed the standardized education curricula,
are politicians, bureaucrats, and fake it until you make artists with something but temporary to prove.
Most had agendas, made trades, deals, promises,
some worked to compress one part, while others added more garbage to the next.
Unlike a road, there is no path that leads up the Tree of Knowledge here,
the standardized curriculum is a patchwork of political fantasies.
It shows a complete misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
and great emphasis on easy administration of tests that only an uneducated voter would see any value in.
Our path of exploration,
is sacred.
You are unique,
you cannot be replaced.
There are no actors,
that could pretend to be you.
And you are a key,
a key to a higher understanding of the Universe and Human Condition.
No one can interrupt your quest for wisdom,
and you should never suspend it or give up.
That beautiful road of questions and answers,
forks, and diverging paths that lead you up.
Up to the very top of the Tree of Knowledge,
to grow up, and move Mountains, and become a Great Being.
That beautiful road and mountains beyond hold the answers,
that the world needs in other to Grow, and Heal, and Mature.
Your life may seem ordinary,
but it is not.
The universe is always gasping for more brilliance,
and when the roads are denied or not taken, it grows darker for it.
Even your sadness,
makes the universe darker.
The world needs you to grow,
it needs our brilliance to become an Enlightened, Wise and Peaceful Place.
It just so happens that we have tiny flaw,
we accept authority, and believe the culture we are born into.
In a world where schools follow a curriculum that is a patchwork,
of political promises, and lowest common denominator garbage meant to easily test progress.
We fall in to the rabbit hole,
we become indoctrinated into the belief that education is not our own path,
But a hodge-podge of trinkets,
that we must toil and moil to unpack to try to make some sense of.
It is possible to follow your own path,
and then come back to school and come out with a perfect grade.
But doing this also adds legitimacy to a very sick system,
that removes people natural predisposition for beauty to replace it with a mere impression of knowledge.
Many will wholly reject the fact that schools are broken,
because it is all they knew.
Heartbreakingly, they will hold up a beautiful book by a beloved Science Popularizer,
and laugh at how it left out at all the things that they have memorized in class.
But Knowledge is not about recalling all the facts,
be it by memorization or mnemonic.
Knowledge, is about synthesizing new observations, new ideas, new challenges,
from magnificent conjecture to newly discovered brilliant theories, formulas, facts, and inventions.
And, not at some abstract point, post graduation which after all a mere piece of paper,
but the genesis of new ideas from the moment you finish reading your fifth book on a subject you like.
The way you progress through your labyrinth of discovery, and that path through the tree of knowledge, is baby step at a time,
sometimes you&apos;ll discover something that will take you left, sometimes right, but you will always move upwards, always growing up.
Your path must be a sequence of steps that make sense to you,
pleasant answers to your curiosities.
Your path is deeply personal,
it helps your mind to grow Strong and Healthy.
Standardized education, is so mixed up that it is best memorized,
but memorization can only be temporary, it is not helpful in ideas synthesis, it is only helpful for actors and pretenders.
Schools are a recent invention, and it was a lot worse before, but now we need more,
a clearer, more personalized, more honest, more loving schools, that help to guide people towards Wisdom and Knowledge.
But to achieve that dream, we must take responsibility for our own education first,
only then will we know how to build the next generation of schools.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Do not drop out of High School,
the Back Row is a special place.
It is how the Universe asks for help,
you are being asked to watch for trouble.
To keep an eye on your bullies,
make sure they all come back from home.
Their violence is an expression of abuse,
there is nothing you can do.
You are being asked to stare into the Teachers Soul,
especially when the bullies come, and she turns her head.
And you are being asked to be the first one to call the police,
if someone is in danger, get everything on video, upload.
Watch the Security Guards,
make sure that everyone is keeping a distance from all the students.
So, by now the teachers have you half way,
towards believing that you are dumb, a loser, and a waste of time.
They have been using you to tidy up their Grade Statistics,
their statistics can&apos;t stick out, they need a usual distribution of grades.
If it was all As, someone would come around asking why,
you are the &quot;F&quot; that makes their bullshit look legitimate.
I know, you know, that your grades your bad, because you were not learning before,
and now you don&apos;t have the base, that would help you understand what the teacher is saying right now.
But you are wrong.
Nobody else learned that stuff either,
even some of the kids that had tutors, didn&apos;t learn it, they just memorized it.
You&apos;d have to be a freak of nature,
to actually comprehend that curriculum, please, please, don&apos;t memorize garbage.
Be careful, the teachers, and principals maybe suffering a kind of collective delusion:
&quot;...The principal and I rejected his alibi and hung a fat zero on his final exam.
That dropped his precalculus grade down from a B+ to a D+.
It lingered like a purple bruise on his college applications.&quot;
Ben Orlin &quot;When Memorization Gets in the Way of Learning&quot; The Atlantic, September 9, 2013.
You are just as smart as everybody else,
you are just as smart as Newton was before he started reading books he liked.
There are no gifted individuals,
but there are individuals who like being celebrated as gifted, of special, or above all else.
They want it so bad,
that they go home and memorize that garbage, garbage.
Even though your mind is perfectly fine,
you still need Knowledge, you need an integrated picture of the world.
A clear picture constructed out of a hundred books,
loved an admired by Intellectuals, Scientists, Philosophers, those who show great achievement.
By sitting in the back row, and constantly being made to feel stupid,
they are stressing you out and preventing you from enjoying life up to a point where you can listen to Audio Books and Lectures.
This place is standing between you and knowledge,
and calling you stupid while its at it.
This is why you can&apos;t drop out,
because if this continues the world will fall apart.
Your real study,
begins right now.
You have to figure out,
how this place works.
Who the teachers answer to,
who the principals answer to.
How are they getting paid,
for this s*it.
You have to understand the school system,
because you are going to fix it.
There is a couple of teachers,
and a handful of students that will help you.
Learn from the internet how to give speeches,
and begin preparing yourself for speaking out against fake education.
Forgive the memorizes, they are often under as much pressure as the bullies are,
they are just better at keeping their mind from fracturing.
Some of them maybe admiring you,
that you are so strong that you don&apos;t pretend to learn.
If one of the girls tries to talk to you,
don&apos;t freak out just say the truth:
&quot;I am shy, I need some time to be able to speak with you,
if you help me, I&apos;ll be your friend.&quot;
and then add,
&quot;I am going to try to fix school, I&apos;ll need a lot of help.&quot;
And everything will work out.
My Friend,
A school that pretends to teach,
is a school that robs you of knowledge.
Civilizations do not die with a bang,
it happens so slowly that nobody notices when all the trees are gone.
How many Tigers are left in your time?
I hope you still have a few, I had 4,000 when I wrote this.
The Nuclear superpowers,
chose Mutually Assured Destruction, over Disarmament.
And prisons were full of people who were warped,
by stress, poverty, and lack of Knowledge,
it was Ten Million at the time of writing.
The blindness starts in school,
when Knowledge is replaced with disconnected facts and memorization.
And it continues,
grow strong my friend,
speak Wisely, Nobly and Loudly.
Imagine what it will be like when it is all over, and schools begin working.
Every formula animated before student&apos;s eyes, paid internships all around the word,
student exchange will be the first and foremost, adventures in England, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and why not.
Student Stipend will grant the students years of Enlightenment and Adventure,
the only grade will be their own path of education from Middle-school to University,
all their curiosities combined together into a Hard Cover book,
that others may follow and improve upon in a Fellowship of Enlightenment.
Begin your journey with A Short History of Nearly Everything, by Bill Bryson,
leap to A People&apos;s History of the United States by Howard Zinn,
for light reading try What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe,
see if you can find a copy of The Giants of Philosophy Series read by Charlton Heston,
and look into The Teaching Company Lectures.
To make money, find a Start-up Accelerator similar to YCombinator near you,
and begin building Virtual Schools Online, borrow from Massively multiplayer online games.
Please don&apos;t be alone, but even if you do end up trying to save the world alone,
you will be in company of great beings, my Friend, and the future generations will stand upon your shoulders.
Here are some Starting Points, Thinkers and Scientists to get you started.

                      <span class="text-muted">For Humans, tragically,
it is either knowledge or conflict.
We come from warring tribes,
humanity has risen from war.
That rise came from,
increasing levels of knowledge.
The modern Human has been around for 200,000 years,
it is the knowledge that we inherit, and pass on, that helps us grow up.
If education is broken,
that that precious knowledge that sets us apart from warring tribes,
will become lost.
The knowledge is hard won, by many great beings,
Women and Men who sacrificed for Future Generations.
We are those generations,
and we must Honor the Philosophers, all the Humanity&apos;s Greatest Thinkers,
by inheriting from them and becoming Great Beings Too.
To fail, is to dishonor,
Humanity&apos;s most beautiful Hopes and Dreams.
Is to break countless hearts,
that date back thousands of years.
We are not that kind of creature.
We are Noble, and Loving, Exceptional,
and Infinitely Intelligent.
We must pay attention,
to the transfer of Knowledge and Wisdom between generations,
we must help the children to the books
The schools are failing,
whatever it is that they are doing,
disconnected facts, and blurry memories are nothing,
and they fail, they fail, and may actually cause harm.
Schools are making people think they are not intelligent enough,
but nothing could be further from the truth
Intelligent is exactly what we are,
we each have great Mental Powers.
Knowledge comes from books,
from lives of other people.
Off the top of our heads,
we will only remember 10 books,
when pressed more than a thousand.
If those books are not read,
if we go through schools, pretending to inherit knowledge.
The global level of knowledge will drop,
the Human Family will begin breaking up smaller,
equally misinformed groups
We will see a rise in nationalism, terrorism,
constant tensions, threats, and protests.
All these anomalies will be pointing away,
from World Peace, Our Dignity and Wisdom.
Imagine two soldiers, both are kids,
both were taught to kill each other by their teachers.
All Humans are equally intelligent,
all are capable of Indescribable Love and Infinite Creativity and Genius.
Their deadly difference,
is in their Knowledge.
And not just what they have been made to believe,
but also, and perhaps more importantly, the level of their knowledge.
The more we know, the more we grow,
the closer we come together.
If their nations granted them real knowledge,
there would be no conflict, no dying, no killing.
And not just Books, but the Recitations of their best Parts,
works of Vonnegut, Whitman, Neruda, Defoe, Melville, Bukowski,
Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Kant, Rand; Bryson, Tyson, and Hitch.
There would be no war,
we&apos;ve already had enough of war.
Education stopped filling us with Knowledge,
schools are pretending to teach now.
Perhaps it has always been the case,
but today, they aren&apos;t even trying.
What student&apos;s learn they learn on their own,
schools just provide the tests and entertainment.
We are more than this,
even though the Doctor may get their M.D.,
there may not be a world to practice in.
The threat of nuclear war has grown,
in the past 50 years the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife.
Just because some percentage of students are learning,
it does not mean that schools are working.
It takes more than a Doctor of a Lawyer,
it takes precisely 7,800,000,000 of well educated and reasonably informed people.
All it takes to get there is free access to audio versions of leading books,
where students can learn in privacy, in peace, and without the threat of shame.
School is fake,
it is not working.
Fake Education is tearing us apart,
pushing the world further into an unsustainable fantasy.
Let us help each other,
please, search the Public Domain for books that move you,
teach your self to narrate them, and share this beautiful art,
out of love, and for peace, and freedom, and for all the future generations to come.
Let us bring levels of knowledge up to where they should be,
we are better than this, we are smarter than this, we are greater than this.
School and education are cold and heartless words.
It is, love of life, and love of wisdom, and love of knowing,
and love of finding things out, and love of The Universe we live in.
Let us stop pretending that education is enough,
Knowledge, we must learn to stand in relentless pursuit of Knowledge,
our Greatest Adventure, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.
Education can make a Doctor,
but it is Knowledge and Wisdom that makes a Great Being.
Let us help the little ones to Knowledge and Wisdom,
so that their children are born to a Kinder, and More Compassionate, and Peaceful World.
A world most worthy of them.
Let us begin by reading, narrating or listening to World&apos;s most beloved non-fiction and adventure books.
For in the absence of real education,
we become the teachers.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Nowhere better can we connect with the Universe,
than that lost and lonely, lonesome dark.
I listened to the crickets, and the frogs,
I listened to the leaves, and waves.
And when the stars and the moon came out,
I&apos;d walk in the sunlight touched the moon.
Never have I been more lonely,
and never closer to Thoreau, Melville, Whitman and Defoe.
There was only one rule of Adventure,
if you see an Antique Store, you must shop, period.
That&apos;s where I found my ancient copy of Robinson Crusoe,
and I&apos;d read it from time to mime, I&apos;d listen to it as an Audio Book as well.
I found Dan Millman&apos;s Peacefull Warrior,
on a bottom shelf in a Dusty Box,
I read it from cover to cover in a single afternoon.
&quot;There are no ordinary moments.&quot;
Each year I went there,
strangers would look at me differently.
I was a Wizard of the Woods once - &quot;Thou shall pass&quot;,
I&apos;d holler stepping out of the way on that steep part of the Arrowhead trail.
Another year I was the Artsy Hobo, I built Driftwood Horses,
and adorn whatever I couldn&apos;t lift with colorful cats.
- I used up all my acrylics.
And early on I was the Raccoon Artist,
I&apos;d trace and sketch huge drawings of raccoons,
they were but a step away from becoming photo-realistic.
On my first long expedition,
I was greeted by a tired Park Ranger that didn&apos;t say a word.
On my way back, he realized I stayed the whole month,
and that it just happened to be the month of perfect sunshine for that year.
Even if it does rain there,
it is always warm rain that never gets in the way.
There was a couple of big storms,
that&apos;s true.
I remember laying on the ground in my tent, with an angry storm outside,
listing to We Are All Connected, by Symphony of Science,
and wondering about the conductivity of my tent poles.

                      <span class="text-muted">They were students, researching, thinking, learning,
they were not renowned scientists, they were just bored programmers looking for a challenge.
Something greater than mathematics, or algorithms, or languages,
they were looking for something more than any of their computers could simulate.
So they started programming,
programming a class of machines that could repair and rebuild themselves.
Really basic stuff, the machines would rely on,
whatever they could absorb from their environment.
They needed to survive indefinitely,
machines that could make machines, and repair, and renew.
A few milestones down the road,
they started thinking about practical applications.
They created tiny capsules that could be launched into already accelerated asteroids,
and even though the capsules were tiny, they had the ability to make countless copies,
and build bacterial colonies large enough to Terraform distant exo-planets.
Upon reaching a nearby stars,
capsules would disperse from forces of gravity and solar radiation.
Eventually land on the nearby exo-planets,
and begin executing their adaptation routine and create copies uniquely bound to the local chemistry.
The programmers setup a simple sequence of steps that would either induce early death,
or later reproduction, with pushing the more adapted information onto the offspring.
All because, there was nothing they could do to create something that would outlast time,
everything decays, we are all bombarded with radiation, protons and muons, and asteroids.
To create something lasting,
it would have to renew it self, rebuild adapt.
It would have to self assemble into colonies or microbiomes,
destroy the problematic, and promote the more adapted.
And spread, and grow, and continue adapting,
the DNA system was noisy enough to allow all kinds of variation.
There was nothing else that could work,
only cellular machinery could adapt without radio, soldering irons, without a forge, without tools,
without a source of heat even, without hands, or brains.
Getting the propulsion systems to work was just as amazing,
anything that whizzed by from small meteors to comets and large asteroids was infused with the capsules.
They even used lasers to accelerate some of the capsules to relativistic speeds,
the cells stored inside the capsules barely noticed any passage of time at all.
Eventually, everything that could sustain DNA based life,
was filled to the brim with it.
Comets, meteors, asteroids would further spread the little machines,
galaxies became cross-contaminated multiple times.
Life is everywhere,
and everywhen.
The Virgo Cluster did not receive the original genetic material,
we have evolved across countless solar systems and many galaxies.
The capsules contained a lot more than generic programming,
they contained instructions on how to establish an interface with it, and maintain it.
And they contained instructions,
on getting back Home, to Methuselah Prime.</span>

and to say Hello, to everybody else, who had the same idea.
We have been studying it even before we became space faring species,
we as in all the species that grew up seeing it with their own eyes.
We&apos;re all humanoid here,
carbon based, mostly the same DNA.
We&apos;ve been talking about the Flowers on Earth,
the Poets, and Libraries; Interesting Books.
Earth has become a Nature Preserve,
well, it has always been a nature preserve,
hence the quiet skies.
Early humans had a lot of problems,
and they needed a lot of help.
The oldest of us date back to the first days of the pandemics,
it was a very strange time.
All planets eventually,
emerge dangerous pathogens.
If there is intelligent life, and if it approaches unsustainable,
some form of Contact is made.
In our case, people just stopped aging,
90 year olds reverted back to their 40s.
We got really smart, it took a few decades to piece it all together,
and then we set off to meet the others at Betelgeuse.
And here here we are,
The Final Frontier, to quote Roddenberry.
It is not a good idea to go Planet Side,
precisely because of pathogens.
Once we leave our solar systems,
we all keep to the Stars.
Time travel is available to us,
the space is infinite, in all dimensions.
The worst thing that happened in the universe were Unlucky species dying alone,
we are now in the process of cataloging everybody by moving through the ancient past.
We are all moving towards where it all begun, Methuselah Prime,
the ancient source of all DNA based life.
It will take an Eternity,
but we&apos;ll get there.

                      <span class="text-muted">Here our Heroines discovered that Social Networks could be used as Human Intelligence based Computer,
and that all it required to build entire governments was the concept of nested groups, (mathematically speaking graphs of sets to which users belong to).
Their research revealed that in 1960&apos;s Detroit, Michigan
was one of the largest Model Cities.
And yet again, that old foe of corruption has emerged,
Model Cities were destroyed by &quot;complicated bureaucracy, inadequate funding, and competing agendas at the local level&quot;.
However, the girls have already worked out,
most of the Anti-Corruption measures.
There will be no such thing as a brand,
or guild.
There will be schools that help people come together,
but the people who satisfy tasks will have their school path, rating and comments to serve as their license.
New comes to a field, such as landscaping,
will charge less until they gain high star rating.
If a large group does grow, it will become divided in two or four,
and this decision will be voted on, by the local community.
It is of some note, that a Landscaping Professional,
claiming a bounty for taking care of a particular set of Condominiums, for example,
can accept cash directly from those who posted the landscaping bounty.
Cosmopolis does not extract a fee for completion of a task or exchange of funds,
there is no need for a bank, storing sensitive information, or constant security audits.
It is really important to be able to to imagine a visit from a landscaping professional,
as a function of Cosmopolis, as an intelligent computer dispatching a human to solve a problem.
When temporary switching to this view,
Cosmopolis becomes an entity powered by the intelligence of millions of humans beings.
The extremely simple idea of voting within a group,
is all the force behind Cosmopolis, it is its intelligence.
When a medical professional notices that the community he is part of could use a hospital,
he can file a Request for Change, and all the members of the community will vote yes or no,
Matters as complex as building a hospital require tens of thousands of tasks,
ranging from arranging for funds, to increasing tips, bounties and scholarships,
so that come a near future, the hospital can begin training medical students.
In some cases, simple program logic will trigger the call for voting on building a new Hospital,
and then human beings will bring in their Intelligence and Expertise.
This scenario serves as an example of Deus Ex Machina,
an intelligent machine powered by Massively Multiuser Self Assembling Intelligence (MMSAI)

                      <span class="text-muted">Once, late at night,
I was prancing in the moonlight.
Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,
and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.
There was an occasional bark or a howl,
but it didn&apos;t get scary till I heard an owl.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she said,
&quot;I am about to swoop down and peck y&apos;all dead.&quot;
&quot;No, thank you Dear Madam&quot;, I sweetly replied,
as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - I heard,
to which I yelled now at a gallop &quot;I ain&apos;t afraid of no bird.&quot;
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,
squirting urine at every step.
And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,
and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.
I was lucky, and my camp was near,
legend has it that she&apos;s still out there filling the woods with fear.
So if if you&apos;re ever out there, and hear a hoot,
better grab onto your butt, and scoot.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">To learn something you must hunger for it,
to learn something, you must love it.
To learn something, you must enjoy it so much, that you will put it aside,
and learn the stuff beneath it first, to grant yourself a fair chance at mastery.
Every little bit counts,
but only if it comes in a sequence that fits what you have already learned.
If you attempt to learn things out of sequence,
or worse yet, trust someone to teach you,
it won&apos;t work, it never has, it never will, forget it.
And it is not just sequence,
it is also the speed at which you learn, that must be taken under consideration.
Sequence and Pace,
now that is just the barbarian level of learning, meant for warriors.
You, can do better than that,
you certainly should.
When you learn is important,
night owls will learn at a different time of day than others.
It is the environment that matters,
some people can&apos;t learn in a city and will needs trees and mountains.
And, the geographic location matters too, if you love numbers, and calculus calls to you,
visit Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz at Neust&#xE4;dter Kirche in Hanover Germany,
visit Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey in London, England.
And remember, Sciences are learned not by memorizing facts,
but by tracing their development across the ages.
Schools are here to teach us,
but they don&apos;t know how.
What they do know,
is how to fake it,
and make it appear like you are learning.
The motive is simple,
for as long as the school gets funding,
everyone gets to keep their job.
Yes,
it is fraud.
Yes, they are selling your mind for a small paycheck,
the curriculum is impossible to learn from.
Curriculum is stitched out of questions that you will have to pass later on,
so that the school can continue to operate, they just want you to retain most of it,
and they will expect you to cram before that test too.
If you want to become a Doctor, Scientist, Mathematician,
you need to be going to a real school, that will encourage you to learn in optimal ways,
a public school is not the optimal setting for education.
A public school is primary for babysitting,
so that you&apos;re not home alone trying to set your or the sticky bandits hair on fire.
In order for that school to exist,
teachers need to get paid,
so you need to pretend to learn by just memorizing,
and passing tests, your grades help the school continue to operate.
Nobody cares if you are learning,
or memorizing.
To graduate with a good GPA, you will have to memorize,
and it will be disconnected facts, they will be out of sequence,
they cannot possibly fit what you already know, and you will forget it all.
In return for hoop jumping you will get a diploma,
and will be accepted to college or university if you cram for the SAT and entrance exams.
In college, your education will be slowed down,
it will be called, balanced education, and they will say it with a straight face like a cult member.
The text books will be $300, lectures $500,
and you can apply for Medical School from here, and move on.
It is hinted that Panama Papers are a good example of what is going on,
there is no central organization that encourages corruption,
it is just that everyone is looking for a shortcut.
You can stand up in class,
but everyone jobs are at stake.
You will be accused of disrupting the class,
and you will be suspended.
They will stress you out,
they will make you tired,
they will make you drop out.
Let me just say,
that you are not allowed to stand by when someone is getting hurt.
If the teacher or security are acting creepy,
talk to the principal, explain that the second time it happens, you will call the police.
The teachers, in their haste will give up on the students in the back,
they have fallen behind on material, but now they are being made to feel that they are unintelligent,
this will destroy their minds, this will cause great harm to their self esteem,
they need your help, get them audio books, Bill Bryson and Carl Sagan.
I think most teachers, when pressured,
will tell you that you are expected to learn on your own,
and in effect confess, that they are useless, when it comes to teaching you for real.
That the classroom is about standardized testing,
for which it is easier to force you to memorize disconnected bits of knowledge that you will soon forget,
then to actually craft a curriculum that will fit all the students,
and match their existing knowledge,
and the natural pace at which they learn,
and their personality.
It used to be true that a single teacher cannot approach all their students in a way that will help them learn,
so to stay in business, they would force them into memorization.
But today, that is not the case. Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,
is because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.
Today, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,
interactive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,
it is possible to approach each student individually,
I am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.
There is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,
that is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.
Even now, I can&apos;t see everything that has gone wrong,
schools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.
But even so, the fact remains,
today schools can&apos;t teach.
They are wicked good,
at tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.
At the end of the day,
you will still need an education.
Your only safe bet,
is becoming self taught,
independent study.
And please, don&apos;t let anybody call you a Genius,
help others, help them find knowledge too.
Finally,
I describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,
on a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.
But, I do know one thing for certain,
this is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.
This is a call for heroism,
for courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.
This is how Life asks for help,
you are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.
Become a Great Being,
Fix Schools.

If you aren&apos;t standing at the Diag, making the moron that was just there shaking with anger,
because you took his microphone, and you started quoting Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Dennett, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali,
Because it is just enough of evil for that particular day,
and you would, save the sunset by bringing in the Saints.
And if you never painted you car pink, especially the interior, because the Pepto Bismol didn&apos;t work,
and you had nowhere to go and noting to eat, but forward and a bag of stale old chips.
Because you couldn&apos;t put the books down,
for all the Love and Wisdom in there.
Why Henry went into the woods at Walden,
and what happened to Gregor Samsa in Metamorphosis,
and how beautifully Will Durant opened his Story to Philosophy,
&quot;Grow strong, my comrade &#x2026; that you may stand
Unshaken when I fall; that I may know
The shattered fragments of my song will come
At last to finer melody in you;
That I may tell my heart that you begin
Where passing I leave off, and fathom more.&quot;
My Friends,
we are not to live quiet little lives,
because we only get one each.
And the way to turn the volume up,
is to inherit wisdom from all the great beings,
at all cost at any cost,
because without their light we can&apos;t tell where we are going.
Get you audio books ready,
and listen, just learn,
listen to all those lives.
All those great beings,
are sharing lifetimes of wisdom with you.
Endure.
Listen.
Teach.
Move Mountains.
Make History.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">By the time you realize how true it is that the world is yours,
all the authority figures you once knew, will have retired.
So in teenage days, just as teachers are brainlessly trying to convince everyone,
that we are not good enough because we don&apos;t listen, or because we are failing their questionable curriculum.
We actually need to take a step back,
and find a way to learn for real.
Because even if, we don&apos;t waste, a single day,
real life will do a pretty good job at overwhelming us anyway.
You need to be learning hard,
with your friends.
You need to be learning,
from Lectures, Documentaries, Audio Books, Maker Shops and Hacker Spaces.
You need to be learning how to build real businesses,
that have a long lasting impact on your community, and maybe the world.
For those of us who aren&apos;t going into cozy Science or Medicine,
we need to come out of High School fists up, fighting, and swinging and kicking.
Because it is not college that should follow High School,
college is something you do for entertainment.
Taking late classes to unwind,
and sharpen your memorization and concept mapping skills.
After High School, you need to put an A-Team together, bitchy parents included,
and cross the Appalachian Trail, and keep in mind, that you may become a regular hiker.
After High School,
your first and only aim, is to find a reasonable path to Greatness.
Do you hear me,
My Friends?
Greatness... because everywhere else,
somehow, unforgivably, may just lead right back to the start.
You just don&apos;t know what it is going to be like when you return,
but you will be part mountain goat, part wild person that comfortably sh*ts in the woods.
And what is more, my friends, you will know, that should life ever challenge you,
you will be able to handle it, with Heart and Soul, with Wisdom, Humor and Grace.
There is not a moment to waste, there is not a day to pass,
make everyone of them count, and then help others to their own paths.
Remind your younger generation,
that they are not to lead sleepy lives of mild discontent.
You are the future, you are wisdom that the world needs to survive,
you are the leaders that are all the Hopes and Dreams of the past generations,
and your rightful stance in life, is that of a Great Being, and nothing less.

                      <span class="text-muted">At first they laughed, then they called them a cult,
then accused them of corruption, and when it was all over,
most called them The Founding Mothers.
We didn&apos;t live under a threat of Nuclear War,
the models predicted the war as 100% certain.
This is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,
Mutually Assured Destruction.
It didn&apos;t take computer models,
it didn&apos;t require an imagination,
war only needs time, guns and borders.
For uneducated humans, war is a certainty,
war is where we all come from.
The models predicted that it would take decades,
nearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.
One of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,
when we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.
When the world connected,
accepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.
The threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,
but leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.
Abandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,
can only occur on generation by generation level.
The generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,
and a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.
No abrupt changes could be made without conflict,
out of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.
And so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,
The League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.
And the Universe,
did smile.
The models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,
would result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.
The most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,
the probability of nuclear war approached 100%.
And as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,
set off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.
The weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,
was going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).
Volunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,
and the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.
Celebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,
to create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.
A number of authors donated their works to the school,
students participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.
By 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,
because it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.
The school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,
and as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.
A new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,
that decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.
These seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,
were achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.
Providing superior education to the children of a nation,
whilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,
is a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.
Rather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,
by participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity&apos;s most beloved books.
World Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,
to blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,
this was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.
We simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,
to the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.
The first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,
it was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.
The reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,
and meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.
It mattered not if it was two boys that Father Gregory Boyle was raising,
or two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.
Once they had access to wisdom,
reality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.
The League of Extraordinary Ladies didn&apos;t stop at Nuclear Disarmament,
their granddaughters ended poverty.
They did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,
they ended poverty by means of poverty.
It was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,
distributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.
The adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,
if someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.
One of the untended features of this program was local pantry,
a feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.
The trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,
in such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.
It is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,
but it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.
We needed programs to help us talk to each other,
and cut out the middle men.
We needed programs that helped cities become more independent,
and stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.
And we needed to begin thinking in decades,
in centuries.
Because our problems, do not end with us,
and what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.
What was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,
given all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.

                      <span class="text-muted">I have searched for great beings,
because I wanted to learn about life.
And I found them,
they are not even rare.
Many are outspoken,
and all over the internet.
Though, far greater in person,
than they show to the public.
They walk among us,
quiet and collected, wise and inspired.
And I wish they could live forever,
because that&apos;s what our world needs.
But they are not going to be around forever,
and they don&apos;t want anything that we can give them.
Except for one thing,
us becoming great beings too.
My Friends, as wonderful and powerful as Wisdom is,
Greatness, Greatness, is what the world needs.
We have to stop accepting things,
just because we were born into them.
We have to stop being lead,
and become leaders.
You wan to know what The Meaning of Life Is,
well let me tell you.
The meaning of your life,
is to become a Great Being.
Everyone of us,
a Great Being.
That is the mistake we made,
we thought that greatness is rare.
But greatness,
is what the world needs of us to grow.
Take to the Books,
take to the audio books (they can&apos;t be easier, and adventure books are breathtaking),
maybe, narrate the classics, and share with the Little Ones.
Avoid everything that is trying to teach you outside-in,
and reach out to learn, to really, really learn, inside-out.
Don&apos;t memorize, don&apos;t seek grades,
just inherit wisdom from a hundred audio books,
and then listen to nine-hundred more, just to be sure.
Let us inherit wisdom from Humanity&apos;s most loved modern audio books,
and let us fill ourselves with knowledge from a thousand lives,
knowledge will grant us wisdom,
and then let us rise and become leaders.
Leadership and Wisdom,
will drive us forward,
to become Great Beings.
Let us do this,
not for Heroes but for Humanity and the future,
for each other.
The world will only become better,
when each of us, accepts the responsibility for becoming a Great Being.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">It felt so healthy to sit down to the first version,
the promise of creating a program that will change the world felt amazing.
They settled on trusty bare bones express,
and the first routes they put in were view and edit.
Carl Sagan once said, that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,
you must first invent the universe.
Ward Cunningham the inventor of WikiWiki,
has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.
With just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,
in the most simplest way possible.
They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,
the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.
In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,
it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.
For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt
The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,
the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.
If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,
and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,
by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,
every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.
It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,
and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,
this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.
So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,
basically a blank Wikipedia.
So now came the big question,
which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?
They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,
after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.
And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,
cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city
This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.
and they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.
Adding user support had to come in next,
just like every city had a page, so did every user.
Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,
Alice and Bob.
Out in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,
and she named the malicious politician Mallory.
Alice and Bob represented computer programs,
they were chatbots.
However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,
they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.
The bots weren&apos;t really inspired by anything other than old MUD programs but there was a beautiful line of code,
that one of the leads always looked at, line 26 in a sample script of github&apos;s hubot.
The bots were special,
they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.
As a whole they already created a very simple,
but living simulation.
For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,
the bot actually got its information from Detroit&apos;s own weather service.
And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,
that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.
Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,
that made working on the system fun.
But by far the most special thing about bots,
was that they could be replaced by a real human,
by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.
In the next release of the program,
the girls focused on enhancing this feature.
A bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,
but when a real person took over for an account,
they could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.
Even in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,
that a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.
As with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,
but it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,
and in the end large cities would go online within weeks,
because it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.
Cosmopolis 2.0 was what got the attention of United Nations,
but that is a story for another time.
Personal Note,
Becoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,
it becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.
There is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,
that contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.
I recommend learning JavaScript, which is currently called ES2020, to actually execute a program you will need an interpreter.
Your browser has one built in, as JavaScript is the language of the web, look up how to open the web console in your browser of choice.
The industry standard for server-side JavaScript applications like our Imaginary Cosmopolis is Node.js,
if interested you can search for video tutorials to help you get started.

&quot;What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere&quot;,
it is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.
It is commonly known as corruption, but that didn&apos;t matter to them,
because they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.
And by everything,
they meant institutions all around the world.
They were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,
&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot;,
The idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,
they would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.
Initially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,
but there was a way to find out.
The thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,
it was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.
The non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,
the bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.
So part of the reason why the programming was so simple,
is that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.
When everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,
and some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.
The thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,
then the program could replace all the management software of a real city.
To their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,
it took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.
They knew that they became famous,
when the UN wouldn&apos;t stop calling.
It worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,
they kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.
The program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,
about 10,000 running copies.
What was fascinating about this,
is that it was still played as a game.
There was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,
that everyone went to for internet news.
The program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML
and to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.
It is a Virtual City at heart,
but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,
it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.
People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,
because their voting history is under their profile.
Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,
some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.
The program as a whole,
eliminated the need for representatives.
People vote on issues that need immediate attention,
and those are the first issues that get solved.
Two amazing things emerged from within the program,
schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),
and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.
Schools started working,
it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.
The second,
people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.
Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,
people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,
the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.
Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,
any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.
People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,
there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.
All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,
so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.
There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,
one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.
The entire process was often ran by bots,
city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.
In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,
were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,
the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,
they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.
Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,
they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.
Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.
The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.
In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.
This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,
again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication
to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.
Prison population dropped.
Nobody called this program a game,
it was always meant to change the world.
The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,
originally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,
But now, decades after the initial release;
the program begun uniting the world.
War, for one became unthinkable,
as people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.
There was no such thing as not having a job,
the cities always needed help with countless tasks.
Corruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,
national borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.
Not that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,
the original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.
What they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,
something that they discovered was once lost in the translation.
Every city now has a sculpture to honor them.
Many of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, &quot;Faster Horses&quot;.
In closing, the conjecture was true.
In the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.
The only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.
It takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.
Where there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Ability to connect with knowledge through audio-books,
and retain that knowledge, as your own,
and build on it to no end, is beyond the powers of Universe.
Inheriting Knowledge to build Wisdom makes you unstoppable,
and once you sit down to write a book of your own you become infinite.
We should not allow anyone to stand between us and our education,
inheritance of knowledge is extremely important to our mental health,
to how we treat each other, and how we interact with the world.
Books are the loveliest things in the world,
my time listening to &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; by Bill Bryson is such a wonderful memory.
I still smile at how shy Henry Cavendish was,
and sometimes I worry about a Kimberlite Pipes popping up somewhere nearby, you never know.
The part where Conway Morris muttered &quot;...not another phylum.&quot;,
got me when I was jogging in the middle of the night at Ann Arbor, MI,
I almost suffocated from laughter.
See a school can&apos;t present knowledge this way,
I know that there are many amazing professors,
but most of them, probably have a fantastic book or series or lectures out.
Knowledge has to be presented with Love and Joy, and maybe a hint of Comedy,
schools of today are coldhearted machines incapable of those emotions.
We can&apos;t just pass the tests that schools expect us to cram for,
we need the actual knowledge, and wonders that will help us become wise.
Life is always asking us to pick a direction,
the wiser we become early on, the happier we will be on the paths we chose.
We must not become tricked into believing we are bad at learning,
there is just no such thing as bad at learning.
Bad grades just prove that middle-school, high-school and college are seriously broken,
the kids that do get good grades and become successful learn outside of school,
and they certainly do not cram before tests they actually learn.
Learning and Schools should not be two separate things,
and there should never be a threat of someone becoming tricked into thinking that they are not smart.
This is a global problem,
the leaders and policy makes who did cram for tests,
they too need a real education that will contribute to their wisdom.
This is not just about fixing High School,
this is about helping Humanity Grow in Wisdom.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">A new age is coming,
an age where the younger generations will end tolerance of blind mistakes.
There will be no more business as usual,
for there was never a usual to be had.
The children can see that borders are hurting the world,
political, cultural, and religious borders keep humanity divided and weak.
The only reason for their tolerance of our mistakes today,
is that they still believe in us, they still think we have the answers they are looking for.
But with internet, and disasters, climate change, and continued threats of nuclear war,
more and more children learn to see that Humanity cannot grow as it is today.
They are the future,
and it is their future.
The revolution will be silent,
there will be no battle, they will just wait us out.
They didn&apos;t even need us to do anything special,
just end their poverty, and give them real schools.
They will watch the videos of us helplessly bailing out corruption,
spouting nonsense about how poverty can&apos;t be fixed, because that&apos;s not how money works.
All the way down,
until all markets collapse to nothing.
This is not a poem about Global Warming and Economic Collapse,
this is a poem about Naked Emperors, and Authenticity.
This is a poem about Real Schools,
that make a real difference for all the kids, most of which still look up to us.
Elementary school is working,
it is perfect, and those teachers are still The Cheerful Heroes they have always been.
Middle School, breaks down under fake education,
as we fail to teach tools for thinking, and sell our children for a small paycheck.
High School, is where the kids figure out it is all fake,
and come home with bad grades to call you out.
College and University,
finally manages to break their beautiful hearts.
Open curriculum, brand name education, networking with the past graduates, lose leaf text books,
debt, and sweet infantile dean feeling shy for wearing the school brand underwear, that one last day of the semester.
That was not a graduation speech old man, that was pain and fear,
that was the declaration that the Emperor is Naked.
The best of the kids who do go through the process,
learn that the can but help a person, a village, but there is no way for them to help the whole world.
Jumping all the hoops does not provide the solutions the entire world needs,
we have to have faith in the future generations enabled by real education, that is our only hope.
Give the kids a school, that will teach them for real,
while there is still a better future to be had.
A school that is worthy of the Infinitely Creative Genius that they really are,
stop pushing them through the mockery of education that removes their unique connection to Knowledge,
and replaces it with Memorization and Fake Grades
Each Human Being has a unique way of connecting with Knowledge and Wisdom,
and every one of those ways has a path that moves at a perfect pace-and-sequence through the sciences.
It can be music, and then Alan Walker, and lmms, and a cover of Alone,
and then the world of programming, and mathematics and signal processing.
It can be Games, Graphics, Game Design, Trigonometry,
Astrophysics, and Orbital Dynamics, and Astrobiology.
It can be Art, a tin of pencils, and a classroom of students,
and inspiration, and speaking, and internship at the UN, and finally Presidency.
It can be Adventure, and bugs, and Photography,
and Film Making, and the Documentary that helps Earth awake in time.
Their paths are much shorter then the ones that strip them off their natural predispositions,
and confine them into rows like slaves,
and cut up knowledge into preached cubes void of sense,
and slow them down to a crawl by presenting incomprehensible lectures,
and memorization games for nothing.
That stupid pointless aim, to keep getting funding,
and pay the staff, so that everyone keeps their crappy jobs,
at the price of the future, and the best minds of our generation.
The result of this madness,
is children losing faith in their own Genius,
and in the Power of Education, and Knowledge and Wisdom.
This is where whoever is left,
that still has strength left,
needs to step in.
Help them regain the belief that they are geniuses,
and that we are all equally gifted.
Help them to Audio Books,
because schools are now hurting them.
Do not let the Little Ones,
give up on their Genius.
We are all gifted, we are all geniuses,
we must all comprehend the world&apos;s leading science books.
We must all grow in Authenticity, in Dignity,
in Insight and Foresight.
For All The Future...

                    <span class="text-muted">Each human being contains precisely one labyrinth mostly consisting of a single long winding road with plenty of forks.
this is their own perfect, private, personal, sacred curriculum.
If they are granted the opportunity to follow it,
at their own pace, in their own way, they will eventually become Wise.
This wondrous road, must double as a library,
and it can only contain Humanity&apos;s Noblest Works of Knowledge and Wisdom.
The men who created, and rebuilt, and mixed up, and reformed the standardized education curricula,
are politicians, bureaucrats, and fake it until you make artists with something but temporary to prove.
Most had agendas, made trades, deals, promises,
some worked to compress one part, while others added more garbage to the next.
Unlike a road, there is no path that leads up the Tree of Knowledge here,
the standardized curriculum is a patchwork of political fantasies.
It shows a complete misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
and great emphasis on easy administration of tests that only an uneducated voter would see any value in.
Our path of exploration,
is sacred.
You are unique,
you cannot be replaced.
There are no actors,
that could pretend to be you.
And you are a key,
a key to a higher understanding of the Universe and Human Condition.
No one can interrupt your quest for wisdom,
and you should never suspend it or give up.
That beautiful road of questions and answers,
forks, and diverging paths that lead you up.
Up to the very top of the Tree of Knowledge,
to grow up, and move Mountains, and become a Great Being.
That beautiful road and mountains beyond hold the answers,
that the world needs in other to Grow, and Heal, and Mature.
Your life may seem ordinary,
but it is not.
The universe is always gasping for more brilliance,
and when the roads are denied or not taken, it grows darker for it.
Even your sadness,
makes the universe darker.
The world needs you to grow,
it needs our brilliance to become an Enlightened, Wise and Peaceful Place.
It just so happens that we have tiny flaw,
we accept authority, and believe the culture we are born into.
In a world where schools follow a curriculum that is a patchwork,
of political promises, and lowest common denominator garbage meant to easily test progress.
We fall in to the rabbit hole,
we become indoctrinated into the belief that education is not our own path,
But a hodge-podge of trinkets,
that we must toil and moil to unpack to try to make some sense of.
It is possible to follow your own path,
and then come back to school and come out with a perfect grade.
But doing this also adds legitimacy to a very sick system,
that removes people natural predisposition for beauty to replace it with a mere impression of knowledge.
Many will wholly reject the fact that schools are broken,
because it is all they knew.
Heartbreakingly, they will hold up a beautiful book by a beloved Science Popularizer,
and laugh at how it left out at all the things that they have memorized in class.
But Knowledge is not about recalling all the facts,
be it by memorization or mnemonic.
Knowledge, is about synthesizing new observations, new ideas, new challenges,
from magnificent conjecture to newly discovered brilliant theories, formulas, facts, and inventions.
And, not at some abstract point, post graduation which after all a mere piece of paper,
but the genesis of new ideas from the moment you finish reading your fifth book on a subject you like.
The way you progress through your labyrinth of discovery, and that path through the tree of knowledge, is baby step at a time,
sometimes you&apos;ll discover something that will take you left, sometimes right, but you will always move upwards, always growing up.
Your path must be a sequence of steps that make sense to you,
pleasant answers to your curiosities.
Your path is deeply personal,
it helps your mind to grow Strong and Healthy.
Standardized education, is so mixed up that it is best memorized,
but memorization can only be temporary, it is not helpful in ideas synthesis, it is only helpful for actors and pretenders.
Schools are a recent invention, and it was a lot worse before, but now we need more,
a clearer, more personalized, more honest, more loving schools, that help to guide people towards Wisdom and Knowledge.
But to achieve that dream, we must take responsibility for our own education first,
only then will we know how to build the next generation of schools.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Do not drop out of High School,
the Back Row is a special place.
It is how the Universe asks for help,
you are being asked to watch for trouble.
To keep an eye on your bullies,
make sure they all come back from home.
Their violence is an expression of abuse,
there is nothing you can do.
You are being asked to stare into the Teachers Soul,
especially when the bullies come, and she turns her head.
And you are being asked to be the first one to call the police,
if someone is in danger, get everything on video, upload.
Watch the Security Guards,
make sure that everyone is keeping a distance from all the students.
So, by now the teachers have you half way,
towards believing that you are dumb, a loser, and a waste of time.
They have been using you to tidy up their Grade Statistics,
their statistics can&apos;t stick out, they need a usual distribution of grades.
If it was all As, someone would come around asking why,
you are the &quot;F&quot; that makes their bullshit look legitimate.
I know, you know, that your grades your bad, because you were not learning before,
and now you don&apos;t have the base, that would help you understand what the teacher is saying right now.
But you are wrong.
Nobody else learned that stuff either,
even some of the kids that had tutors, didn&apos;t learn it, they just memorized it.
You&apos;d have to be a freak of nature,
to actually comprehend that curriculum, please, please, don&apos;t memorize garbage.
Be careful, the teachers, and principals maybe suffering a kind of collective delusion:
&quot;...The principal and I rejected his alibi and hung a fat zero on his final exam.
That dropped his precalculus grade down from a B+ to a D+.
It lingered like a purple bruise on his college applications.&quot;
Ben Orlin &quot;When Memorization Gets in the Way of Learning&quot; The Atlantic, September 9, 2013.
You are just as smart as everybody else,
you are just as smart as Newton was before he started reading books he liked.
There are no gifted individuals,
but there are individuals who like being celebrated as gifted, of special, or above all else.
They want it so bad,
that they go home and memorize that garbage, garbage.
Even though your mind is perfectly fine,
you still need Knowledge, you need an integrated picture of the world.
A clear picture constructed out of a hundred books,
loved an admired by Intellectuals, Scientists, Philosophers, those who show great achievement.
By sitting in the back row, and constantly being made to feel stupid,
they are stressing you out and preventing you from enjoying life up to a point where you can listen to Audio Books and Lectures.
This place is standing between you and knowledge,
and calling you stupid while its at it.
This is why you can&apos;t drop out,
because if this continues the world will fall apart.
Your real study,
begins right now.
You have to figure out,
how this place works.
Who the teachers answer to,
who the principals answer to.
How are they getting paid,
for this s*it.
You have to understand the school system,
because you are going to fix it.
There is a couple of teachers,
and a handful of students that will help you.
Learn from the internet how to give speeches,
and begin preparing yourself for speaking out against fake education.
Forgive the memorizes, they are often under as much pressure as the bullies are,
they are just better at keeping their mind from fracturing.
Some of them maybe admiring you,
that you are so strong that you don&apos;t pretend to learn.
If one of the girls tries to talk to you,
don&apos;t freak out just say the truth:
&quot;I am shy, I need some time to be able to speak with you,
if you help me, I&apos;ll be your friend.&quot;
and then add,
&quot;I am going to try to fix school, I&apos;ll need a lot of help.&quot;
And everything will work out.
My Friend,
A school that pretends to teach,
is a school that robs you of knowledge.
Civilizations do not die with a bang,
it happens so slowly that nobody notices when all the trees are gone.
How many Tigers are left in your time?
I hope you still have a few, I had 4,000 when I wrote this.
The Nuclear superpowers,
chose Mutually Assured Destruction, over Disarmament.
And prisons were full of people who were warped,
by stress, poverty, and lack of Knowledge,
it was Ten Million at the time of writing.
The blindness starts in school,
when Knowledge is replaced with disconnected facts and memorization.
And it continues,
grow strong my friend,
speak Wisely, Nobly and Loudly.
Imagine what it will be like when it is all over, and schools begin working.
Every formula animated before student&apos;s eyes, paid internships all around the word,
student exchange will be the first and foremost, adventures in England, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and why not.
Student Stipend will grant the students years of Enlightenment and Adventure,
the only grade will be their own path of education from Middle-school to University,
all their curiosities combined together into a Hard Cover book,
that others may follow and improve upon in a Fellowship of Enlightenment.
Begin your journey with A Short History of Nearly Everything, by Bill Bryson,
leap to A People&apos;s History of the United States by Howard Zinn,
for light reading try What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe,
see if you can find a copy of The Giants of Philosophy Series read by Charlton Heston,
and look into The Teaching Company Lectures.
To make money, find a Start-up Accelerator similar to YCombinator near you,
and begin building Virtual Schools Online, borrow from Massively multiplayer online games.
Please don&apos;t be alone, but even if you do end up trying to save the world alone,
you will be in company of great beings, my Friend, and the future generations will stand upon your shoulders.
Here are some Starting Points, Thinkers and Scientists to get you started.

                    <span class="text-muted">For Humans, tragically,
it is either knowledge or conflict.
We come from warring tribes,
humanity has risen from war.
That rise came from,
increasing levels of knowledge.
The modern Human has been around for 200,000 years,
it is the knowledge that we inherit, and pass on, that helps us grow up.
If education is broken,
that that precious knowledge that sets us apart from warring tribes,
will become lost.
The knowledge is hard won, by many great beings,
Women and Men who sacrificed for Future Generations.
We are those generations,
and we must Honor the Philosophers, all the Humanity&apos;s Greatest Thinkers,
by inheriting from them and becoming Great Beings Too.
To fail, is to dishonor,
Humanity&apos;s most beautiful Hopes and Dreams.
Is to break countless hearts,
that date back thousands of years.
We are not that kind of creature.
We are Noble, and Loving, Exceptional,
and Infinitely Intelligent.
We must pay attention,
to the transfer of Knowledge and Wisdom between generations,
we must help the children to the books
The schools are failing,
whatever it is that they are doing,
disconnected facts, and blurry memories are nothing,
and they fail, they fail, and may actually cause harm.
Schools are making people think they are not intelligent enough,
but nothing could be further from the truth
Intelligent is exactly what we are,
we each have great Mental Powers.
Knowledge comes from books,
from lives of other people.
Off the top of our heads,
we will only remember 10 books,
when pressed more than a thousand.
If those books are not read,
if we go through schools, pretending to inherit knowledge.
The global level of knowledge will drop,
the Human Family will begin breaking up smaller,
equally misinformed groups
We will see a rise in nationalism, terrorism,
constant tensions, threats, and protests.
All these anomalies will be pointing away,
from World Peace, Our Dignity and Wisdom.
Imagine two soldiers, both are kids,
both were taught to kill each other by their teachers.
All Humans are equally intelligent,
all are capable of Indescribable Love and Infinite Creativity and Genius.
Their deadly difference,
is in their Knowledge.
And not just what they have been made to believe,
but also, and perhaps more importantly, the level of their knowledge.
The more we know, the more we grow,
the closer we come together.
If their nations granted them real knowledge,
there would be no conflict, no dying, no killing.
And not just Books, but the Recitations of their best Parts,
works of Vonnegut, Whitman, Neruda, Defoe, Melville, Bukowski,
Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Kant, Rand; Bryson, Tyson, and Hitch.
There would be no war,
we&apos;ve already had enough of war.
Education stopped filling us with Knowledge,
schools are pretending to teach now.
Perhaps it has always been the case,
but today, they aren&apos;t even trying.
What student&apos;s learn they learn on their own,
schools just provide the tests and entertainment.
We are more than this,
even though the Doctor may get their M.D.,
there may not be a world to practice in.
The threat of nuclear war has grown,
in the past 50 years the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife.
Just because some percentage of students are learning,
it does not mean that schools are working.
It takes more than a Doctor of a Lawyer,
it takes precisely 7,800,000,000 of well educated and reasonably informed people.
All it takes to get there is free access to audio versions of leading books,
where students can learn in privacy, in peace, and without the threat of shame.
School is fake,
it is not working.
Fake Education is tearing us apart,
pushing the world further into an unsustainable fantasy.
Let us help each other,
please, search the Public Domain for books that move you,
teach your self to narrate them, and share this beautiful art,
out of love, and for peace, and freedom, and for all the future generations to come.
Let us bring levels of knowledge up to where they should be,
we are better than this, we are smarter than this, we are greater than this.
School and education are cold and heartless words.
It is, love of life, and love of wisdom, and love of knowing,
and love of finding things out, and love of The Universe we live in.
Let us stop pretending that education is enough,
Knowledge, we must learn to stand in relentless pursuit of Knowledge,
our Greatest Adventure, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.
Education can make a Doctor,
but it is Knowledge and Wisdom that makes a Great Being.
Let us help the little ones to Knowledge and Wisdom,
so that their children are born to a Kinder, and More Compassionate, and Peaceful World.
A world most worthy of them.
Let us begin by reading, narrating or listening to World&apos;s most beloved non-fiction and adventure books.
For in the absence of real education,
we become the teachers.</span>

Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines.
