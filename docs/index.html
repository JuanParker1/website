what I am about to say.
Yes,
it is all connected.
You can learn the Melbourne Shuffle nearly instantly,
if you start with Alan Walker&apos;s Faded.
There is a springy sound in between the beat past the intro,
that&apos;s where you contract your core, that&apos;s the middle step,
that divides mere shuffling feet; from actual Melbourne Shuffle.
The only other thing you have to remember,
is that the leg you lift goes forward, and then you switch legs.
The sound controls your body,
start with a slower song or a different genre and it will be a lot harder,
for a person who is just starting, it may be too hard to try to dance to a different song.
And music is basically a program,
it is just Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies assembled into a song.
You can easily break down Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies into their structure,
you can hear it in your ear, you can write it down on paper, in color, with squiggles and emphasis.
But there is a better way, even better than LMMS,
and that is programming.
A song you program can play forever,
and the programming language that you learn along the way, is actually a method for interfacing with technology,
The GUI is a very slow method of controlling computers,
the command line, automation of the command line, and writing commands you can use and automate,
is the first, and really the only way to get computers to work for us, not against us.
And on the other spectrum, you can write a program,
that will control your dance, the very way you move.
It is all connected, Sam Aaron is correct in his analogy,
we don&apos;t learn to write to become book authors, we just need it,
and we don&apos;t learn programming to sit in an office cubicle all day long,
We do it to save day,
to save some time,
and to dance that time away.

                      <span class="text-muted">The distance between Science and Play, between Adventurer and Scientist,
approaches zero will approach zero in proportion to just how much fun you are having.
My first independent invention was a CD based Car MP3 player in 1998,
there were many other mp3 player patents, dating many years back, I didn&apos;t invent anything new.
My second invention about 10 year later, was a freaking star-ship,
and it was safe to teenagers fly.
It was a high altitude balloon with a miniature craft that would beam down video and movement of the platform,
to a trailer down on the ground where the crew would be experiencing all the motion in near real time.
Once the balloon pops it would be possible to the dismay of the FAA, and evey other three letter agancy,
to attempt to stair it, the kids in the trailer on the ground would be getting real feedback to whatever the heck they were trying to do.
Once someone slams the deploy parachute button,
the miniature craft would slow its descent, the trailer would shudder.
My third invention, from just not too far back was a board game,
but a fascinating one.
Amazon sells see through acrylic padlocks, and deadbolts for locksmith training,
and I realized that one could create a little game out of them.
Basically the players would have to lock-pick their way through the game,
they would each receive a little lock picking kit, which is the real deal.
As a bonus the last door they would have to pick,
was the door to their own house.
This would teach the players to find a quality lock,
and actually help them in real life.
And just now, I am toying with the extremely CPU intensive post processing of photographs,
I was just able to bring color to an infrared photo taken in the middle of the night.
There are no practical applications,
I am just looking towards astrography, contemplating the milky way.
Toying with a program called ZeroMQ,
it is just meant to send information between programs and commuters,
but I can also see that it could control a large array of cameras and I am just wondering what that could mean for slow motion,
super resolution, and things like home made supernovae detection software.
It is all fun and games, I am hardly programming any of this, and it is all just about as unscientific as it can be,
but it does help with day dreams, having a bold idea, and looking into it, teaches something.
This kind of exploratory learning, or self education,
if far more powerful than reading textbooks, or listening to lectures.
Do not be afraid of imagining interesting things,
take to the microscope, infrared and thermal imaging.
I think self education is the only way to make the world a better place,
treat school for what it is, and don&apos;t let it stand between you and real knowledge, and fun.

                      <span class="text-muted">I think that is how the great thinkers learned in the past,
they would grab onto something like Gravitation, Electromagnetism, Pendulums,
and try to figure out how they worked, what forces influenced the things they observed.
Inventing and Invention, makes us think of Pet Rocks, Chia Pets, and Cheap Junk,
but the true meaning of invention is following your path of curiosities.
For example, aren&apos;t you curious about Infrared Photography?
Infrared Lamps that but emit a faint red color, but light up an IR Photo,
Infrared Camera for Raspberry PI Zero costs $12, and the UNIX based Raspberry PI Zero just about $20,
Raspberry PI contains a couple commands with dozens of options that you can tinker with,
from ISO, shutter speed, to options like brightness and contrast.
Just a simple curiosity can lead you on a path of exploring UNIX,
Photography, the Light Spectrum, and even let you brush against Astrography.
Where you get to think about flaws in your Charge Coupled Device (CCD Sensor),
and how you have to hunt down and eliminate the dead pixels.
And what great please it is to see that your photos are flawless,
and then begin stacking them to average out and remove noise,
all these little triumphs add to your Knowledge and Wisdom.
It is OK to be overwhelmed, but it is not OK to shy away from something that captured your interest because it seems too confusing,
the confusion just comes from not knowing all the steps to get to taking your first IR photo.
Start with the $150 8GB Raspberry PI 4, get a couple of monitors,
and create your first laboratory.
Then get the $20 Raspberry PI Zero, and you&apos;ll have your first computer network,
with a satellite Raspberry Zero, that only requires power, so it just needs a single cable.
Attach the Noir Camera to it,
and start exploring what it means to average images to eliminate noise.
Another Raspberry Zero,
this time with a normal $9 camera, can watch your flowers with time laps photography.
This is an example of a modern path of invention,
from this point on, you get to choose your own next steps.
You can study Node.js, UNIX, Bash, and become a programmer,
you can move on beyond the digital and buy your first $200 DIY 3D Printer,
and for example print cases for your Raspberry PIs.
After some practice with the servo motors,
you can build a Raspberry Powered Telescope,
that also doubles as a Deadly Space Laser, hey you never know, it is 2020 after all.
This is how the Great Beings that invented the experiment of mandatory public education, learned.
Baby Step, by Baby Step.
traveling a decades long journey with with curiosities and adventures.
A journey where every new step adds to the previous,
to create a body of Knowledge and Wisdom.
When you feel you hit a milestone, write a tutorial on how you did it,
on what you improved, make some video tutorials, and put them on your resume,
show your inventors or employer that you know that your mind has no limits,
and that you are a Brilliant Inventor, and a Fine Scientist.

                      <span class="text-muted">You are a great inventor, invention is something we do naturally,
but you need to detox from all the hustle and bustle of busy life.
Your private inventions usually build on something someone else did,
so social networks, websites, photography, and maybe art.
If you just sit down with something that fascinates you,
and play with it, you are bound to invent something new.
Let us start with a silly example,
You could create a custom phone ring service, where people yell names...
so when someone calls Alan, the phone actually screams for him.
And here your invention would be about how your relate to voice artists, what tools you give them,
would you also create an addition where the phone yells the name of the person that is calling.
Something more serious would be a social network that takes all your weekly posts,
and creates a part of a chapter in your memoir, here the users can order a paper hard copy,
you could customize this idea by providing beautifully bound books that feature posts from many users,
and you may even simply rely on existing social networks.
Not all starting points require the internet,
or complexity for that matter.
Do you know about Spin Art,
if you could invent a personal touch, maybe something to do with 3D features, or thread,
every Dentist&apos;s Office would feature your fantastic art, your signature, and website address,
and you could even publish a coffee book about your art.
For something less abstract consider building a tilt-shift photography service,
where you get a little drone to fly up to get a giant&apos;s view, and take the most fascinating photos,
for weddings, real-estate, even newspaper articles.
For something more startling, you could start with macro photography,
now entering a realm that everyone can&apos;t help but to be fascinated with,
enormous six foot canvas featuring tiny bugs.
You could even go deeper and do Photomicrography,
and here you enter a world that very few people think about, some may even find your photos unbelievable,
this kind of work would get you featured in national galleries.
If you don&apos;t like still photography, consider setting up cheap time laps cameras all over the place,
and then sell them as background video for speeches, or poetry, or add classical music and call it a new way to hear it,
or call it the study of passage of time, and make a documentary about it, to get at your first Oscar.
Not all inventions need to make money or fame,
but all inventions must fascinate you.
They have to call to your soul,
to your health, to your curiosity.
You have thousands of ideas in your mind,
slow down, get in touch with your Inventive Side,
and help the world become more beautiful.

                      <span class="text-muted">My Friends,
No century is ordinary, and such is the case with this one,
you have a little bit of work to do, you may need to slow down with school and work a bit.
You will be creating a series of books about Real Education, Governing the World,
Human Rights, and a beautiful Survey Course half-jokingly entitled, The Human Manual.
Today computers are everywhere, and they hold a powerful potential,
one that can enhance Education, The Voter and Democracy,
one that can simplify bureaucracies and Governments.
Humanity has been greatly enhanced by the experiment of mandatory education and free access to knowledge,
but the systems of standardized education have fallen behind on times,
we must now use computers to cater to individual students,
and to remove the need of grades, replacing it with a simple history of self chosen subjects.
This a great endeavor,
for which few are ready.
As it always happens in Human History,
this challenge has been pressed upon our shoulders all too soon,
it has been accelerated by Climate Change, Anthropocene Extinction, Mass Incarceration,
and Needles Borders that uselessly Divide our Human Family.
This century a Divided Humanity is a Weak Humanity,
to face all the challenges and to ready the Younger Generations to carry on,
we must unite, the Internet has been Ready for years now.
What follows is an imperfect outline,
of much needed works that aim to Strengthen Humanity,
and help all the children with all the challenges they are soon to face.
Book One: Real Education,
this is a choose your own adventure type experience, that is to be published as a Paper Book,
as an Audio Book, as a Video Book, and finally taught in schools as a series of lectures.
This is very important, My Friends, in 2020, at the time of writing this document,
schools were unable to teach students, they would only force them into memorization,
the motive was to receive state funding so that all school employees would get paid.
(Much will be said on this subject, but much of it won&apos;t matter,
because efficacy of education is _not_ judged by its collective test scores and trends,
but rather; results. Its positive impact on the Voter, and City, State, and Nation Governments,
and above all the well being of our Planet.)
Book Two: Governing The World,
is a book about establishing a Computer Program Managed Democracy,
it is very much an augmented reality, a mirror of our world where our voices count for more.
The program harnesses the Wisdom of the Educated Humanity;
for City, State, Nation, and Earth management.
It is worth noting that it is to have its beginnings as a Interactive Fiction game,
that is collaboratively expanded, much like the world encyclopedia.
Book Three: Human Rights,
is a volume detailing stories about growing up in the world,
it is just essays that highlight what people can do to help the World Grow,
and how to go about it to become triumphant.
This book speaks about a path to a United Humanity,
it is not just about putting an end to the idea of borders as the European Union so nobly demonstrates,
but it is about getting ready to commit all ideas that result in dividing us to history books,
and accepting the fact that we are just one family, that we are the Wise Caretakers of Earth and all of Her Inhabitants.
Human Rights must also highlight the problem of inequality that leads to Incarceration,
people are going to prisons due to lack of Education and Knowledge.
Due to Stress, Poverty. Mental Disorders and Illness some of which is rooted in Neurological Disorders born from poverty, addiction, and unsafe environments.
Prisons must be replaced with Schools,
Human beings do not belong in cages.
Furthermore,
The first and foremost purpose of a Government is to end poverty, homelessness, hunger, and sickness to the best of our abilities.
This means a Universal Basic Income, real money indistinguishable from a paycheck earned by hard work.
People who face Poverty, Hunger, Homelessness, treatable Illness,
who feel isolated or excluded, will be unable to study and comprehend these great Works of Love that this text describes.
We are One Family, we need their help, we need all of Humanity to permanently come together and leave bad ideas behind.
Book Four: The Human Manual,
Is a Book of world&apos;s most inspirational and beloved essays.
It contains the following;
cheerful chapters for Mighty Five Year Olds,
inspiring essays for the Unstoppable Ten Year Olds,
a loving introduction to the complexity of the world for Fifteen Year olds,

                      <span class="text-muted">If loneliness, school, or work has you stressed out,
and in haste you are slowly forgetting where your lines are.
Here&apos;s a bit of magic for you,
it will help you separate who you are, from what you choose to do.
Keep a backpack by your front door,
make sure it is always stuffed full of goodies and ready to go.
Even if it is autumn, or winter,
and there isn&apos;t anywhere to go.
Keep your backpack by the door,
it will remind you that you are free,
and you choose to work hard.
We mustn&apos;t forget that to really sleep,
we must be rested first, and then wait for the sunset.
To really wake up, we have to let our body decide,
we can&apos;t be ripped out of sleep by an alarm.
Each day, must count,
and add to the previous.
And make us stronger, and wiser,
and a bit healthier and overall, better.
If things ever get rough,
it is high time for adventure.
You drive home,
but don&apos;t turn off the car.
Pop in just to grab the backpack,
find a place with decent weather, and ride.
It will take you three days,
to pull your self back together.
And it will be really hard at first,
it will feel like you must go back.
But you can&apos;t live a life,
that is making you lose yourself in haste.
You need to pull yourself together,
and the first three days are the hardest.
The next three days,
will show you that you are returning to normal.
You will sleep longer,
it will feel like a deep breath.
And finally,
you will relax.
And here after a week or two,
you will feel much healthier.
Do not push yourself too hard,
you have to take good care of yourself.
People that care about you will appreciate your well-being,
much more than your hard work.
So, a backpack by the door,
and as a fantastic bonus.
You get to go shopping,
and shopping is the best form of mediation there is.
Start with mosquito repellent sticks that you light on fire,
keep them some distance away from your tent.
Figure out what poison ivy looks like and stay away from it,
leaves of three leave it be, but get some antihistamines and over-the-counter corticosteroid for other bites.
Bring an expensive solar battery charger,
and backup power-bank meant to recharge your specific cell phone a few times.
Audio books are critical, you must not forget.
make sure you at least have Bill Bryson&apos;s &quot;A Walk in The Woods&quot; and &quot;Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;.
Don&apos;t forget to get a good Rambo knife, or two, and preferably cut-proof gloves,
be careful, a sharp knife is often the most &quot;dangerous&quot; thing on your adventure.
You may need a large metal mug for cooking,
or a cooking-kit, often it is just better to sharpen a stick and have a sausage.
Adventure is the best time to practice your chopstick skills,
you&apos;ll never need a fork, if any old stick snapped in half will do.
Bring a fancy hat, and some mighty sunscreen,
don&apos;t let the sun get to you.
A trusty headlamp, with some extra batteries,
will help you in the dark, watch out for owls.
You will need a first aid kit,
duct tape is your friend here,
but get bandage and disinfectant too.
Matches, Zippo, and zippo lighter fluid,
here the fluid will double as fire starter,
and get some fire starter products like wax sticks and candles.
And you will need some para-cord,
for easily dragging firewood to your camp.
Get an inexpensive tent, there are some that are very light weight,
but you are laying down on the ground and your back may not like that.
Some people just travel with a lightweight hammock,
specifically crafted to replace a tent, so get both, and see which one works out.
You will need a sleeping bag,
I always bought the warmest ones.
Get a water-bottle,
and just in case get some water purification tablets.
Toothpaste, toothbrush,
and toiletries.
Always remember to dangle your food on a few feet of para-cord high up in a tree,
it will give the cute little Raccoons a workout, an you&apos;ll get to keep your food.
Raccoons are smart enough to fiddle with your tent zipper until they can get inside,
so get a tiny luggage padlock and lock the zipper eyelets together.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Living is Art,
so lift your brush to the canvas, Dear Friends.
Fatigue, overwork, imbalance, tiredness,
all conspire to keep us running in circles.
Especially, right before setting off on an adventure,
sometimes it takes up to a week, to remember who we are.
First couple of days, are the worst,
it feels like adventure is not worth it, and we need to go back.
Back to what?
And how many years has it been now?
Adventure is a cute upside-down word,
hoping to remind you that you are full of energy and sunshine.
That you are a professional troublemaker,
and a fancy bookworm.
As good as your poker face is, under stress,
Ohh, the sh*tstorm that you will sow and reap, with your beautiful and perfect deadpan comedy,
upon an unsuspecting fellow shopper, whilst waiting in the checkout line at the local Supermarket.
They won&apos;t *ever* know what hit them, and you will uncontrollably giggle all the way back to your car,
whilst crunching the ice cream with sprinkles you just bought, with a whole new level of joy.
Nevermind, that for the first time in your life you own a phat marker,
and you started tagging the toilets with your incredible and edgy wit.
You&apos;ll get it under control,
I know you will.
There is just a couple of little problems that we do need to talk about...
(and this does not apply to all, just a couple of my readers)
Firstly, stop answering kind greetings &quot;Oh, hey, how are you?&quot; with,
&quot;Still Here&quot; - honestly, we know, we&apos;ve noticed, we just want to known how you are doing this?
And then telling people that you are, or used to be, or whatever: a Firefighter - must stop,
honestly, most people already assumed - that you used you volunteer - to put out hot fires.
Your multiple fanny packs, that&apos;s on point, everybody knows that all the great superheroes,
from Dwayne The Rock Goddamn Johnson to Tomb Raider and Freaky Batman, root and toot for you.
Now, this poem would be incomplete if I didn&apos;t ask you to get up right now,
and stretch a leg or two, a bit, and lookup Nurnberg Trailhead at W Nurnberg Rd, Free Soil, MI 49411.
Or any other tiny Wilderness that&apos;s not too near, not too far,
and spend the afternoon picking out a backpack, a fancy little tent...
The fluffiest sleeping bag you can find,
and one of those fancy inflatable pillows that will make you pass right out.
Grab a box of matches, the biggest, baddest Overkill Rambo knife you can find,
a water bottle, peanut butter wonder bread, a confusing compass and a load of sausages.
And go, don&apos;t delay, if the northern hemisphere is cold,
head on south, if south is cranky, head on north.
You are not supposed live to work,
you are only supposed to work just enough, to live so that you can Read and Listen to Books, and Grow.
Every day is the first day of the rest of your life,
and young or old, every day is a beautiful gift.
And there is no such thing as old age,
that&apos;s just a boogie man that the cowards made up
(If they can&apos;t become a great adventurer, why should anybody else)
Old age is a privilege, denied to many.
People that care about you want you to be Healthy, and Mighty,
they want you to be an Inspiration, that will forever inspire them to, Greatness.
Do not let a day go by...
And gol dang it, you&apos;re a Warrior.
Get two Rambo knives, the one on the left for sausages.
The one on the right, for throwing...
and for chopping Wood, and Moose, and Beaver
- that are so foolish as to wonder into your beautiful campsite.
Eat them,
or Curse Them!
But whatever you do,
get moving right now.
Due north, due south,
whichever is more welcoming.
Go.
Gooooolly, Go.

                      <span class="text-muted">Schools and Teachers, Universities, Colleges, and Professors, and even Politicians,
all had an amazing opportunity to enable the current generations with Real Education.
They will keep saying that they are working on it, and that they love students,
but then they will get confused and put politics first, creating that Hollow Feeling again.
You know what, they have ran out of time,
this is a big century for Human Kind.
We started out on the wrong foot,
we doubled the total of fossil fuel emissions in the last 25 years.
When Al Gore was working on his book,
he was writing in a world that had half the atmospheric emission we do.
You see, we are the leaders now, the intellectuals, the poets, the artists,
the people who failed to stop that doubling have retired or passed away.
If we were to ask them what they did it,
they could only say &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;
No blame, no accountability,
the change is so slow that the men who were destroying the world are gone.
The next 80 years is really important,
we can&apos;t afford to test if perhaps fake education will work out for us if we cram.
It maybe time, to temporarily push away from the promise of a diploma and a job,
and catch up with what has been going on in the world.
Reading and listening to real books is important,
taking responsibility for our own education, is very important.
You get to pick your Audio Books, your own Lecture Videos,
watch Documentaries about Climate and Nature, maybe Politics.
Keep a journal, do a book review,
for every Audio Book and Documentary you like.
And get out there, go camping, and adventuring.
Maybe even section hike the Appalachian Trail, or the Pacific Crest Trail,
or El Camino de Santiago and Kom-Emine, with your friends and parents.
Let the sunrise tell you when it is time to study,
let the sunset help you to sleep.
A lot that was lost in translation during standardized education,
can be pretty quickly regained, with top non-fiction, as long as you make room for it.
So, let us consider taking a year off when we feel ready for books,
maybe before college, or before we transfer to a university.
The journal and corresponding hiking videos or book reviews,
will provide plenty of evidence that it was not a year that was merely lost.
It seems that our Elder Selves will not hold falling in love with books against us,
to the contrary, this maybe one of those things that they wish for.

                      <span class="text-muted">Humanity is like a Garden,
and Humans are flowers that grow with Knowledge.
No one flower can make the other grow,
but we can share and pass on good ideas amongst each other.
All those good ideas combined,
form our body of Knowledge.
Only with real knowledge,
can we bloom in Wisdom.
A Blooming Garden,
is a Higher Power.
To help Humanity grow,
free and mandatory education was invented.
Our level of knowledge rose,
and it rose high enough for us to want more.
The original schools in their zeal to process everyone,
are attempting to confine the garden withing its small walls.
The schools are a simple and dumb machine,
aim to produce the same bunch of flowers.
New, smart technology, has emerged,
and we are now able to Listen to Books and Pick our own Lectures.
And we must do so,
and as quickly as possible.
Let us then choose a small and interesting adventure,
and in the perfect sequence, and at just the right pace.
Begin our study of what we like,
and not what somebody else wants us to like.
The flowers need Real Knowledge to Bloom,
and real knowledge can only be gained and sustained by what we enjoy.
Each flower leans towards a unique constellation of starts,
there is nothing that can be standardized about Real Education.
Standardized Education can only destroy spirit and creativity,
exhaust us, spark by irreplaceable spark, and without ever lighting the flame.
As soon as you feel that school is holding you back,
read your own books, watch your own documentaries and lectures.
Real education, is your own education,
one that you will care for and nurture with passion and joy throughout your entire existence.
Personal Note,
It may feel silly at first,
when you finally take your first baby steps towards something you like.
But that is just a beginning,
they are always very little.
The beautiful thing about it,
is that your first step, will be quickly followed by your second one.
For example,
You may take to watercolors,
and it will all come out a crooked doodle.
But that does not mean that it is over,
or that you are not a genius.
It means you need to buy,
a $100 Video Projector.
Take a selfie,
project it on your watercolor paper.
Use a pencil to mark where colors go,
and now you can paint anew.
Oh, and by the way, to lower color saturation,
mix it with the color opposite, on the color wheel.
Now armed with those two baby steps,
ask your heart, where to go next?
Posters, Murals, Pixel Art,
and if you are unsure, then take a break...
and design and write a small art book about finding a good projector,
and selecting just the right paints, so that you may deeply reflect n what moves you.
Everything comes with a sweet and beautiful little road like this,
we are all human, and what we achieve, we achieve with our hearts.
One of the reasons why many of the wonders that we admire today, exist,
is because someone found a pleasant path to get there a baby step at a time.
Now it might have taken them ten years of baby steps to get there,
but since it was what they loved, they didn&apos;t even think of it as a challenge.
When we follow the path that enriches us,
high achievement becomes indistinguishable from growing up.
Later on in life,
as we face new challenges.
It will be our sweet little pursuits and lessons,
that will offer us the answers we need.
And do so by subtle and beautiful analogy,
to the little problems that we solved in our happy pursuits of yesteryear.</span>

is all there is, and it is all that will hold the world together.
From the little seed of your notebook, your trusty pencil,
that one thing you posted on the internet that still impresses you,
grows a Brilliant Thinker.
A Custodian of Knowledge, A Lover of Wisdom,
and a Great Being.
If you choose to practice resignation, if you fall,
the link of chain that holds the past and the future of Humanity will weaken.
The many Hearts, of The Great Beings that rose before you,
will wail and howl, and the universe will become permanently darker for it.
School is just the best all of the uneducated humanity at the time could agree on,
it is our first best try, and it was a failure that in its misery will now serve us,
as a source of wisdom for building the second generation of schools.
This time everybody can see, that proper education is the best hope humanity has,
this time we will know the price that an Miseducated Earth pays.
People that made you feel unintelligent, made a mistake out of desperation,
because they couldn&apos;t have know how to teach, because the idea of the classroom,
and standardized education and testing is just an uninformed political fantasy,
crafted for simple and convincing displays of progress, and easy reelection campaigns.
School was invented as an experiment by Great Self Taught Beings,
though it is broken, it still serves to keep the Global Level of Knowledge high enough,
for us to communicate about leaving bad ideas behind, and which are worth keeping.
We know it will be based on the way the Self Taught learn,
we know there will be no grades, just your brilliant path through the tree of knowledge.
The new generation of schools will bring Humanity closer together,
it will help us take better care of our Planet and its Inhabitants.
We used to think that school was an island,
but it turned out to be the very thing that steers humanity forward in time.
You were seen as students once,
and now you will be seen as Earth&apos;s Captains,
Lighthouse Keepers, Navigators, and Admirals.
If I may,
Let us begin by taking to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
and setting it as the Opening Chapter of the New Text Book,
in recognition that school is directly responsible,
for the future of Earth and all her Inhabitants.
May the first lesson, of this first New Text Book,
stand to describe how vulnerable we are to cultural indoctrination,
and the resulting following without thinking.
May it serve as a cautionary tale,
and as an inspiration to Leadership, clear thinking,
and always choosing the harder right over the easier wrong.
May all the countless chapters of this new book help each student,

                      <span class="text-muted">Each human being contains precisely one labyrinth mostly consisting of a single long winding road with plenty of forks.
this is their own perfect, private, personal, sacred curriculum.
If they are granted the opportunity to follow it,
at their own pace, in their own way, they will eventually become Wise.
This wondrous road, must double as a library,
and it can only contain Humanity&apos;s Noblest Works of Knowledge and Wisdom.
The men who created, and rebuilt, and mixed up, and reformed the standardized education curricula,
are politicians, bureaucrats, and fake it until you make artists with something but temporary to prove.
Most had agendas, made trades, deals, promises,
some worked to compress one part, while others added more garbage to the next.
Unlike a road, there is no path that leads up the Tree of Knowledge here,
the standardized curriculum is a patchwork of political fantasies.
It shows a complete misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
and great emphasis on easy administration of tests that only an uneducated voter would see any value in.
Our path of exploration,
is sacred.
You are unique,
you cannot be replaced.
There are no actors,
that could pretend to be you.
And you are a key,
a key to a higher understanding of the Universe and Human Condition.
No one can interrupt your quest for wisdom,
and you should never suspend it or give up.
That beautiful road of questions and answers,
forks, and diverging paths that lead you up.
Up to the very top of the Tree of Knowledge,
to grow up, and move Mountains, and become a Great Being.
That beautiful road and mountains beyond hold the answers,
that the world needs in other to Grow, and Heal, and Mature.
Your life may seem ordinary,
but it is not.
The universe is always gasping for more brilliance,
and when the roads are denied or not taken, it grows darker for it.
Even your sadness,
makes the universe darker.
The world needs you to grow,
it needs our brilliance to become an Enlightened, Wise and Peaceful Place.
It just so happens that we have tiny flaw,
we accept authority, and believe the culture we are born into.
In a world where schools follow a curriculum that is a patchwork,
of political promises, and lowest common denominator garbage meant to easily test progress.
We fall in to the rabbit hole,
we become indoctrinated into the belief that education is not our own path,
But a hodge-podge of trinkets,
that we must toil and moil to unpack to try to make some sense of.
It is possible to follow your own path,
and then come back to school and come out with a perfect grade.
But doing this also adds legitimacy to a very sick system,
that removes people natural predisposition for beauty to replace it with a mere impression of knowledge.
Many will wholly reject the fact that schools are broken,
because it is all they knew.
Heartbreakingly, they will hold up a beautiful book by a beloved Science Popularizer,
and laugh at how it left out at all the things that they have memorized in class.
But Knowledge is not about recalling all the facts,
be it by memorization or mnemonic.
Knowledge, is about synthesizing new observations, new ideas, new challenges,
from magnificent conjecture to newly discovered brilliant theories, formulas, facts, and inventions.
And, not at some abstract point, post graduation which after all a mere piece of paper,
but the genesis of new ideas from the moment you finish reading your fifth book on a subject you like.
The way you progress through your labyrinth of discovery, and that path through the tree of knowledge, is baby step at a time,
sometimes you&apos;ll discover something that will take you left, sometimes right, but you will always move upwards, always growing up.
Your path must be a sequence of steps that make sense to you,
pleasant answers to your curiosities.
Your path is deeply personal,
it helps your mind to grow Strong and Healthy.
Standardized education, is so mixed up that it is best memorized,
but memorization can only be temporary, it is not helpful in ideas synthesis, it is only helpful for actors and pretenders.
Schools are a recent invention, and it was a lot worse before, but now we need more,
a clearer, more personalized, more honest, more loving schools, that help to guide people towards Wisdom and Knowledge.
But to achieve that dream, we must take responsibility for our own education first,
only then will we know how to build the next generation of schools.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Do not drop out of High School,
the Back Row is a special place.
It is how the Universe asks for help,
you are being asked to watch for trouble.
To keep an eye on your bullies,
make sure they all come back from home.
Their violence is an expression of abuse,
there is nothing you can do.
You are being asked to stare into the Teachers Soul,
especially when the bullies come, and she turns her head.
And you are being asked to be the first one to call the police,
if someone is in danger, get everything on video, upload.
Watch the Security Guards,
make sure that everyone is keeping a distance from all the students.
So, by now the teachers have you half way,
towards believing that you are dumb, a loser, and a waste of time.
They have been using you to tidy up their Grade Statistics,
their statistics can&apos;t stick out, they need a usual distribution of grades.
If it was all As, someone would come around asking why,
you are the &quot;F&quot; that makes their bullshit look legitimate.
I know, you know, that your grades your bad, because you were not learning before,
and now you don&apos;t have the base, that would help you understand what the teacher is saying right now.
But you are wrong.
Nobody else learned that stuff either,
even some of the kids that had tutors, didn&apos;t learn it, they just memorized it.
You&apos;d have to be a freak of nature,
to actually comprehend that curriculum, please, please, don&apos;t memorize garbage.
Be careful, the teachers, and principals maybe suffering a kind of collective delusion:
&quot;...The principal and I rejected his alibi and hung a fat zero on his final exam.
That dropped his precalculus grade down from a B+ to a D+.
It lingered like a purple bruise on his college applications.&quot;
Ben Orlin &quot;When Memorization Gets in the Way of Learning&quot; The Atlantic, September 9, 2013.
You are just as smart as everybody else,
you are just as smart as Newton was before he started reading books he liked.
There are no gifted individuals,
but there are individuals who like being celebrated as gifted, of special, or above all else.
They want it so bad,
that they go home and memorize that garbage, garbage.
Even though your mind is perfectly fine,
you still need Knowledge, you need an integrated picture of the world.
A clear picture constructed out of a hundred books,
loved an admired by Intellectuals, Scientists, Philosophers, those who show great achievement.
By sitting in the back row, and constantly being made to feel stupid,
they are stressing you out and preventing you from enjoying life up to a point where you can listen to Audio Books and Lectures.
This place is standing between you and knowledge,
and calling you stupid while its at it.
This is why you can&apos;t drop out,
because if this continues the world will fall apart.
Your real study,
begins right now.
You have to figure out,
how this place works.
Who the teachers answer to,
who the principals answer to.
How are they getting paid,
for this s*it.
You have to understand the school system,
because you are going to fix it.
There is a couple of teachers,
and a handful of students that will help you.
Learn from the internet how to give speeches,
and begin preparing yourself for speaking out against fake education.
Forgive the memorizes, they are often under as much pressure as the bullies are,
they are just better at keeping their mind from fracturing.
Some of them maybe admiring you,
that you are so strong that you don&apos;t pretend to learn.
If one of the girls tries to talk to you,
don&apos;t freak out just say the truth:
&quot;I am shy, I need some time to be able to speak with you,
if you help me, I&apos;ll be your friend.&quot;
and then add,
&quot;I am going to try to fix school, I&apos;ll need a lot of help.&quot;
And everything will work out.
My Friend,
A school that pretends to teach,
is a school that robs you of knowledge.
Civilizations do not die with a bang,
it happens so slowly that nobody notices when all the trees are gone.
How many Tigers are left in your time?
I hope you still have a few, I had 4,000 when I wrote this.
The Nuclear superpowers,
chose Mutually Assured Destruction, over Disarmament.
And prisons were full of people who were warped,
by stress, poverty, and lack of Knowledge,
it was Ten Million at the time of writing.
The blindness starts in school,
when Knowledge is replaced with disconnected facts and memorization.
And it continues,
grow strong my friend,
speak Wisely, Nobly and Loudly.
Imagine what it will be like when it is all over, and schools begin working.
Every formula animated before student&apos;s eyes, paid internships all around the word,
student exchange will be the first and foremost, adventures in England, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and why not.
Student Stipend will grant the students years of Enlightenment and Adventure,
the only grade will be their own path of education from Middle-school to University,
all their curiosities combined together into a Hard Cover book,
that others may follow and improve upon in a Fellowship of Enlightenment.
Begin your journey with A Short History of Nearly Everything, by Bill Bryson,
leap to A People&apos;s History of the United States by Howard Zinn,
for light reading try What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe,
see if you can find a copy of The Giants of Philosophy Series read by Charlton Heston,
and look into The Teaching Company Lectures.
To make money, find a Start-up Accelerator similar to YCombinator near you,
and begin building Virtual Schools Online, borrow from Massively multiplayer online games.
Please don&apos;t be alone, but even if you do end up trying to save the world alone,
you will be in company of great beings, my Friend, and the future generations will stand upon your shoulders.
Here are some Starting Points, Thinkers and Scientists to get you started.

                      <span class="text-muted">For Humans, tragically,
it is either knowledge or conflict.
We come from warring tribes,
humanity has risen from war.
That rise came from,
increasing levels of knowledge.
The modern Human has been around for 200,000 years,
it is the knowledge that we inherit, and pass on, that helps us grow up.
If education is broken,
that that precious knowledge that sets us apart from warring tribes,
will become lost.
The knowledge is hard won, by many great beings,
Women and Men who sacrificed for Future Generations.
We are those generations,
and we must Honor the Philosophers, all the Humanity&apos;s Greatest Thinkers,
by inheriting from them and becoming Great Beings Too.
To fail, is to dishonor,
Humanity&apos;s most beautiful Hopes and Dreams.
Is to break countless hearts,
that date back thousands of years.
We are not that kind of creature.
We are Noble, and Loving, Exceptional,
and Infinitely Intelligent.
We must pay attention,
to the transfer of Knowledge and Wisdom between generations,
we must help the children to the books
The schools are failing,
whatever it is that they are doing,
disconnected facts, and blurry memories are nothing,
and they fail, they fail, and may actually cause harm.
Schools are making people think they are not intelligent enough,
but nothing could be further from the truth
Intelligent is exactly what we are,
we each have great Mental Powers.
Knowledge comes from books,
from lives of other people.
Off the top of our heads,
we will only remember 10 books,
when pressed more than a thousand.
If those books are not read,
if we go through schools, pretending to inherit knowledge.
The global level of knowledge will drop,
the Human Family will begin breaking up smaller,
equally misinformed groups
We will see a rise in nationalism, terrorism,
constant tensions, threats, and protests.
All these anomalies will be pointing away,
from World Peace, Our Dignity and Wisdom.
Imagine two soldiers, both are kids,
both were taught to kill each other by their teachers.
All Humans are equally intelligent,
all are capable of Indescribable Love and Infinite Creativity and Genius.
Their deadly difference,
is in their Knowledge.
And not just what they have been made to believe,
but also, and perhaps more importantly, the level of their knowledge.
The more we know, the more we grow,
the closer we come together.
If their nations granted them real knowledge,
there would be no conflict, no dying, no killing.
And not just Books, but the Recitations of their best Parts,
works of Vonnegut, Whitman, Neruda, Defoe, Melville, Bukowski,
Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Kant, Rand; Bryson, Tyson, and Hitch.
There would be no war,
we&apos;ve already had enough of war.
Education stopped filling us with Knowledge,
schools are pretending to teach now.
Perhaps it has always been the case,
but today, they aren&apos;t even trying.
What student&apos;s learn they learn on their own,
schools just provide the tests and entertainment.
We are more than this,
even though the Doctor may get their M.D.,
there may not be a world to practice in.
The threat of nuclear war has grown,
in the past 50 years the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife.
Just because some percentage of students are learning,
it does not mean that schools are working.
It takes more than a Doctor of a Lawyer,
it takes precisely 7,800,000,000 of well educated and reasonably informed people.
All it takes to get there is free access to audio versions of leading books,
where students can learn in privacy, in peace, and without the threat of shame.
School is fake,
it is not working.
Fake Education is tearing us apart,
pushing the world further into an unsustainable fantasy.
Let us help each other,
please, search the Public Domain for books that move you,
teach your self to narrate them, and share this beautiful art,
out of love, and for peace, and freedom, and for all the future generations to come.
Let us bring levels of knowledge up to where they should be,
we are better than this, we are smarter than this, we are greater than this.
School and education are cold and heartless words.
It is, love of life, and love of wisdom, and love of knowing,
and love of finding things out, and love of The Universe we live in.
Let us stop pretending that education is enough,
Knowledge, we must learn to stand in relentless pursuit of Knowledge,
our Greatest Adventure, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.
Education can make a Doctor,
but it is Knowledge and Wisdom that makes a Great Being.
Let us help the little ones to Knowledge and Wisdom,
so that their children are born to a Kinder, and More Compassionate, and Peaceful World.
A world most worthy of them.
Let us begin by reading, narrating or listening to World&apos;s most beloved non-fiction and adventure books.
For in the absence of real education,
we become the teachers.</span>

than that lost and lonely, lonesome dark.
I listened to the crickets, and the frogs,
I listened to the leaves, and waves.
And when the stars and the moon came out,
I&apos;d walk in the sunlight touched the moon.
Never have I been more lonely,
and never closer to Thoreau, Melville, Whitman and Defoe.
There was only one rule of Adventure,
if you see an Antique Store, you must shop, period.
That&apos;s where I found my ancient copy of Robinson Crusoe,
and I&apos;d read it from time to mime, I&apos;d listen to it as an Audio Book as well.
I found Dan Millman&apos;s Peacefull Warrior,
on a bottom shelf in a Dusty Box,
I read it from cover to cover in a single afternoon.
&quot;There are no ordinary moments.&quot;
Each year I went there,
strangers would look at me differently.
I was a Wizard of the Woods once - &quot;Thou shall pass&quot;,
I&apos;d holler stepping out of the way on that steep part of the Arrowhead trail.
Another year I was the Artsy Hobo, I built Driftwood Horses,
and adorn whatever I couldn&apos;t lift with colorful cats.
- I used up all my acrylics.
And early on I was the Raccoon Artist,
I&apos;d trace and sketch huge drawings of raccoons,
they were but a step away from becoming photo-realistic.
On my first long expedition,
I was greeted by a tired Park Ranger that didn&apos;t say a word.
On my way back, he realized I stayed the whole month,
and that it just happened to be the month of perfect sunshine for that year.
Even if it does rain there,
it is always warm rain that never gets in the way.
There was a couple of big storms,
that&apos;s true.
I remember laying on the ground in my tent, with an angry storm outside,
listing to We Are All Connected, by Symphony of Science,
and wondering about the conductivity of my tent poles.

                      <span class="text-muted">They were students, researching, thinking, learning,
they were not renowned scientists, they were just bored programmers looking for a challenge.
Something greater than mathematics, or algorithms, or languages,
they were looking for something more than any of their computers could simulate.
So they started programming,
programming a class of machines that could repair and rebuild themselves.
Really basic stuff, the machines would rely on,
whatever they could absorb from their environment.
They needed to survive indefinitely,
machines that could make machines, and repair, and renew.
A few milestones down the road,
they started thinking about practical applications.
They created tiny capsules that could be launched into already accelerated asteroids,
and even though the capsules were tiny, they had the ability to make countless copies,
and build bacterial colonies large enough to Terraform distant exo-planets.
Upon reaching a nearby stars,
capsules would disperse from forces of gravity and solar radiation.
Eventually land on the nearby exo-planets,
and begin executing their adaptation routine and create copies uniquely bound to the local chemistry.
The programmers setup a simple sequence of steps that would either induce early death,
or later reproduction, with pushing the more adapted information onto the offspring.
All because, there was nothing they could do to create something that would outlast time,
everything decays, we are all bombarded with radiation, protons and muons, and asteroids.
To create something lasting,
it would have to renew it self, rebuild adapt.
It would have to self assemble into colonies or microbiomes,
destroy the problematic, and promote the more adapted.
And spread, and grow, and continue adapting,
the DNA system was noisy enough to allow all kinds of variation.
There was nothing else that could work,
only cellular machinery could adapt without radio, soldering irons, without a forge, without tools,
without a source of heat even, without hands, or brains.
Getting the propulsion systems to work was just as amazing,
anything that whizzed by from small meteors to comets and large asteroids was infused with the capsules.
They even used lasers to accelerate some of the capsules to relativistic speeds,
the cells stored inside the capsules barely noticed any passage of time at all.
Eventually, everything that could sustain DNA based life,
was filled to the brim with it.
Comets, meteors, asteroids would further spread the little machines,
galaxies became cross-contaminated multiple times.
Life is everywhere,
and everywhen.
The Virgo Cluster did not receive the original genetic material,
we have evolved across countless solar systems and many galaxies.
The capsules contained a lot more than generic programming,
they contained instructions on how to establish an interface with it, and maintain it.
And they contained instructions,
on getting back Home, to Methuselah Prime.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We have traveled to watch Alpha Orionis undergo Supernova,
and to say Hello, to everybody else, who had the same idea.
We have been studying it even before we became space faring species,
we as in all the species that grew up seeing it with their own eyes.
We&apos;re all humanoid here,
carbon based, mostly the same DNA.
We&apos;ve been talking about the Flowers on Earth,
the Poets, and Libraries; Interesting Books.
Earth has become a Nature Preserve,
well, it has always been a nature preserve,
hence the quiet skies.
Early humans had a lot of problems,
and they needed a lot of help.
The oldest of us date back to the first days of the pandemics,
it was a very strange time.
All planets eventually,
emerge dangerous pathogens.
If there is intelligent life, and if it approaches unsustainable,
some form of Contact is made.
In our case, people just stopped aging,
90 year olds reverted back to their 40s.
We got really smart, it took a few decades to piece it all together,
and then we set off to meet the others at Betelgeuse.
And here here we are,
The Final Frontier, to quote Roddenberry.
It is not a good idea to go Planet Side,
precisely because of pathogens.
Once we leave our solar systems,
we all keep to the Stars.
Time travel is available to us,
the space is infinite, in all dimensions.
The worst thing that happened in the universe were Unlucky species dying alone,
we are now in the process of cataloging everybody by moving through the ancient past.
We are all moving towards where it all begun, Methuselah Prime,
the ancient source of all DNA based life.
It will take an Eternity,
but we&apos;ll get there.

                      <span class="text-muted">Here our Heroines discovered that Social Networks could be used as Human Intelligence based Computer,
and that all it required to build entire governments was the concept of nested groups, (mathematically speaking graphs of sets to which users belong to).
Their research revealed that in 1960&apos;s Detroit, Michigan
was one of the largest Model Cities.
And yet again, that old foe of corruption has emerged,
Model Cities were destroyed by &quot;complicated bureaucracy, inadequate funding, and competing agendas at the local level&quot;.
However, the girls have already worked out,
most of the Anti-Corruption measures.
There will be no such thing as a brand,
or guild.
There will be schools that help people come together,
but the people who satisfy tasks will have their school path, rating and comments to serve as their license.
New comes to a field, such as landscaping,
will charge less until they gain high star rating.
If a large group does grow, it will become divided in two or four,
and this decision will be voted on, by the local community.
It is of some note, that a Landscaping Professional,
claiming a bounty for taking care of a particular set of Condominiums, for example,
can accept cash directly from those who posted the landscaping bounty.
Cosmopolis does not extract a fee for completion of a task or exchange of funds,
there is no need for a bank, storing sensitive information, or constant security audits.
It is really important to be able to to imagine a visit from a landscaping professional,
as a function of Cosmopolis, as an intelligent computer dispatching a human to solve a problem.
When temporary switching to this view,
Cosmopolis becomes an entity powered by the intelligence of millions of humans beings.
The extremely simple idea of voting within a group,
is all the force behind Cosmopolis, it is its intelligence.
When a medical professional notices that the community he is part of could use a hospital,
he can file a Request for Change, and all the members of the community will vote yes or no,
Matters as complex as building a hospital require tens of thousands of tasks,
ranging from arranging for funds, to increasing tips, bounties and scholarships,
so that come a near future, the hospital can begin training medical students.
In some cases, simple program logic will trigger the call for voting on building a new Hospital,
and then human beings will bring in their Intelligence and Expertise.
This scenario serves as an example of Deus Ex Machina,
an intelligent machine powered by Massively Multiuser Self Assembling Intelligence (MMSAI)

                    <span class="text-muted">I know you know,
what I am about to say.
Yes,
it is all connected.
You can learn the Melbourne Shuffle nearly instantly,
if you start with Alan Walker&apos;s Faded.
There is a springy sound in between the beat past the intro,
that&apos;s where you contract your core, that&apos;s the middle step,
that divides mere shuffling feet; from actual Melbourne Shuffle.
The only other thing you have to remember,
is that the leg you lift goes forward, and then you switch legs.
The sound controls your body,
start with a slower song or a different genre and it will be a lot harder,
for a person who is just starting, it may be too hard to try to dance to a different song.
And music is basically a program,
it is just Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies assembled into a song.
You can easily break down Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies into their structure,
you can hear it in your ear, you can write it down on paper, in color, with squiggles and emphasis.
But there is a better way, even better than LMMS,
and that is programming.
A song you program can play forever,
and the programming language that you learn along the way, is actually a method for interfacing with technology,
The GUI is a very slow method of controlling computers,
the command line, automation of the command line, and writing commands you can use and automate,
is the first, and really the only way to get computers to work for us, not against us.
And on the other spectrum, you can write a program,
that will control your dance, the very way you move.
It is all connected, Sam Aaron is correct in his analogy,
we don&apos;t learn to write to become book authors, we just need it,
and we don&apos;t learn programming to sit in an office cubicle all day long,
We do it to save day,
to save some time,
and to dance that time away.

approaches zero will approach zero in proportion to just how much fun you are having.
My first independent invention was a CD based Car MP3 player in 1998,
there were many other mp3 player patents, dating many years back, I didn&apos;t invent anything new.
My second invention about 10 year later, was a freaking star-ship,
and it was safe to teenagers fly.
It was a high altitude balloon with a miniature craft that would beam down video and movement of the platform,
to a trailer down on the ground where the crew would be experiencing all the motion in near real time.
Once the balloon pops it would be possible to the dismay of the FAA, and evey other three letter agancy,
to attempt to stair it, the kids in the trailer on the ground would be getting real feedback to whatever the heck they were trying to do.
Once someone slams the deploy parachute button,
the miniature craft would slow its descent, the trailer would shudder.
My third invention, from just not too far back was a board game,
but a fascinating one.
Amazon sells see through acrylic padlocks, and deadbolts for locksmith training,
and I realized that one could create a little game out of them.
Basically the players would have to lock-pick their way through the game,
they would each receive a little lock picking kit, which is the real deal.
As a bonus the last door they would have to pick,
was the door to their own house.
This would teach the players to find a quality lock,
and actually help them in real life.
And just now, I am toying with the extremely CPU intensive post processing of photographs,
I was just able to bring color to an infrared photo taken in the middle of the night.
There are no practical applications,
I am just looking towards astrography, contemplating the milky way.
Toying with a program called ZeroMQ,
it is just meant to send information between programs and commuters,
but I can also see that it could control a large array of cameras and I am just wondering what that could mean for slow motion,
super resolution, and things like home made supernovae detection software.
It is all fun and games, I am hardly programming any of this, and it is all just about as unscientific as it can be,
but it does help with day dreams, having a bold idea, and looking into it, teaches something.
This kind of exploratory learning, or self education,
if far more powerful than reading textbooks, or listening to lectures.
Do not be afraid of imagining interesting things,
take to the microscope, infrared and thermal imaging.
I think self education is the only way to make the world a better place,
treat school for what it is, and don&apos;t let it stand between you and real knowledge, and fun.

                    <span class="text-muted">I think that is how the great thinkers learned in the past,
they would grab onto something like Gravitation, Electromagnetism, Pendulums,
and try to figure out how they worked, what forces influenced the things they observed.
Inventing and Invention, makes us think of Pet Rocks, Chia Pets, and Cheap Junk,
but the true meaning of invention is following your path of curiosities.
For example, aren&apos;t you curious about Infrared Photography?
Infrared Lamps that but emit a faint red color, but light up an IR Photo,
Infrared Camera for Raspberry PI Zero costs $12, and the UNIX based Raspberry PI Zero just about $20,
Raspberry PI contains a couple commands with dozens of options that you can tinker with,
from ISO, shutter speed, to options like brightness and contrast.
Just a simple curiosity can lead you on a path of exploring UNIX,
Photography, the Light Spectrum, and even let you brush against Astrography.
Where you get to think about flaws in your Charge Coupled Device (CCD Sensor),
and how you have to hunt down and eliminate the dead pixels.
And what great please it is to see that your photos are flawless,
and then begin stacking them to average out and remove noise,
all these little triumphs add to your Knowledge and Wisdom.
It is OK to be overwhelmed, but it is not OK to shy away from something that captured your interest because it seems too confusing,
the confusion just comes from not knowing all the steps to get to taking your first IR photo.
Start with the $150 8GB Raspberry PI 4, get a couple of monitors,
and create your first laboratory.
Then get the $20 Raspberry PI Zero, and you&apos;ll have your first computer network,
with a satellite Raspberry Zero, that only requires power, so it just needs a single cable.
Attach the Noir Camera to it,
and start exploring what it means to average images to eliminate noise.
Another Raspberry Zero,
this time with a normal $9 camera, can watch your flowers with time laps photography.
This is an example of a modern path of invention,
from this point on, you get to choose your own next steps.
You can study Node.js, UNIX, Bash, and become a programmer,
you can move on beyond the digital and buy your first $200 DIY 3D Printer,
and for example print cases for your Raspberry PIs.
After some practice with the servo motors,
you can build a Raspberry Powered Telescope,
that also doubles as a Deadly Space Laser, hey you never know, it is 2020 after all.
This is how the Great Beings that invented the experiment of mandatory public education, learned.
Baby Step, by Baby Step.
traveling a decades long journey with with curiosities and adventures.
A journey where every new step adds to the previous,
to create a body of Knowledge and Wisdom.
When you feel you hit a milestone, write a tutorial on how you did it,
on what you improved, make some video tutorials, and put them on your resume,
show your inventors or employer that you know that your mind has no limits,
and that you are a Brilliant Inventor, and a Fine Scientist.

Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
