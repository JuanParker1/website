                      <span class="text-muted">Though mighty, we are very delicate creatures,
our minds require Beauty and Calm to learn the most at their best.
Haste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,
homework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.
Learning for real, real education, useful knowledge,
thriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.
In real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,
doesn&apos;t actually do anything.
Reality, demands real things,
truth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.
A beautiful life,
requires our full beauty.
To bloom, to truly grow up,
we need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.
It is not as easy as it sounds,
though we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.
What about, the less obvious things?
Such as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,
but on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.
So you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?
that is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?
And what about the quality of that test,
and what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?
And what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,
in effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.
And what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,
what if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?
Reality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,
but you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.
At no point should you be pushed to the side,
and forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.
And do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,
spending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn&apos;t guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.
Now, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,
and eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.
So, High School, College, University and a Career,
does not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.
If you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,
you can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.
Just for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,
and zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.
Cults and religions are not the only indoctrination,
they are just the ones that are trivial to catch.
A Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,
but even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.
Even an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,
as you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.
Lets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,
is a sign that you are being taken advantage of.
Learning is not about memorization,
and memorization has nothing to do with learning.
Memorization is best used in poetry,
it a way to give thanks to poets.
Even if you memorize numbers of a new language,
all you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.
Memorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,
is almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.
To learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,
watch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.
We are good at language,
just like we are good at dance, don&apos;t force it, love it.
Your Knowledge is sacred,
it empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.
When someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,
you must become very suspicious of their motives.
The world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,
sometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.
You have to find a way to learn things right,
I think we all know, that way, is not the school way.
I know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,
but you see, that won&apos;t go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.
Moreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,
you become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.
It is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,
it is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.
The way to push back against manipulators,
is to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.
At most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,
though they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.
25 audio books is like a month of your life,
and, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.
You will always return to where you were as you read them,
so you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.
You can either start your life with a heart break,
or with adventure and audio books.
Grab your friends, tell them to behave,
and go together.
If I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,
as neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.
I found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,
it fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can&apos;t even.
Look for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,
and keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.
Use the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,
they are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.
That is all you need, to create an adventure,
a path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.
And promise to drive carefully,
you are not in a hurry.
Now, not everyone is ready to write,
but some of you are a lot further along than you think.
Begin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,
and that&apos;s it, don&apos;t press, flow.
Just like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,
and need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.
My friends, same goes for our minds,
fear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.
Do you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?
Impatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,
sadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.
These are not things that we can fix, you can&apos;t take pain killers for body aches from from fear.
By calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,
but it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.
In a way, psychology is a young science,
it is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.
There aren&apos;t too many answers here,
but there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.
The secret to a long and healthy life is:
Happiness.
I am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,
and get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.
Happiness is quite a thing,
it is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.
Where wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,
happiness makes you a powerful doctor.
The low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,
that will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.
Has the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,
and plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.
I once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,
and somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:
The Laughing Philosopher.
While, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,
I am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.
And I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,
or dragged away by a condor.
And I know for certain, that the saddest of us,
are the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.
All you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,
that the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.
Fight the urge to turn the car around,
that is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.
It will only take a few days,
and then, everything changes.
Oh my, when you get out of your car,
and your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.
By taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,
you can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.
And hearing your first chipmunk,
will absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.
No job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,
has any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?
You joy of life is sacred,
everything else has to be secondary.
You are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,
when you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.
Call it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,
but keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.
Because that will mark the rise of your own personal University,
and the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">School, wisdom, philosophy, job, university, career, writing, politics, adventure, grades, greatness, soul,
how can you tell which of these are real, outdated or just not worth your time?
By finding your beginning, of course,
and then weaving an unbroken thread that makes you rise.
We are born of chaos and accident, but we are a masterpiece of the Universe,
the time required to permute all combinations of chemicals to give rise to life is, long.
We are here, because as unlikely as life is,
eventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.
When you look around this planet,
despite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.
I think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,
but unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can&apos;t build cities of thoughts and dreams.
In a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:
rare.
In two words:
Beautiful and Rare.
We have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,
and see what we can weave with it.
In the misery of cold caves,
or the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.
In the dark ages of child labor,
or the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.
In the age of Mustard Gas,
or poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.
In the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,
Cold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.
But in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,
where what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.
We grew,
my friends, it happened just now, just like that.
A new way of learning:
Audio Books on The Trail.
No university lecture,
can beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.
Unlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,
or in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.
A professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,
but he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.
A memoir,
will.
All the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,
to books about the promise of World Peace...
And if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,
by contrast a Professor&apos;s smile is meaningless, if not fake.
Professors can only interfere with your development,
no single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.
While your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,
there is something else, you need.
You need a taste of Greatness,
you will never find it in a University town, never.
There is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,
those are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.
When you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,
in rain in snow...
...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,
I am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.
For how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,
by putting you into a little dorm room.
And no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,
to impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.
How could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,
than your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.
No professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,
as a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.
And the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening&apos;s bonfire,
that thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.
He wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,
but you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.
Let the trail,
become your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.
SPEAK OUT,
do not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.
SPEAK OUT,
do not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.
SPEAK OUT,
tell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.
Speak Out,
speak out.
In wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,
it is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.
The Trail,
and that thread, are one and the same.
And the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,
in cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.
After a few years,
what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.
A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,
and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.
Your own book,
will start.
And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,
and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.
That&apos;s how you will know what is real,
what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.
Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,
wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.
And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,
you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.
Take your self-education to the trails,
the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.
Don&apos;t worry, it will be OK,
so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.
And the last thing a Great Being discovers,
is the answer to their first big question &quot;Who am I?&quot;, it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.
Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,
and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Do you remember wondering about becoming an adult?
wanting to be done with this dumb kid stuff and have Ice Cream... even in winter.
Just being half pint is not that big of a deal,
it is the not knowing, what adults know, that&apos;s the hard part.
For some of us this is a book, or a manual, or the mystery of philosophy,
but what we are actually trying to picture is... Wisdom.
Even as babies we know that wisdom separates a child from an adult,
it isn&apos;t just about growing older, anybody can just age, it is about Wisdom.
Much of Wisdom comes from inheriting lifetimes of knowledge from books,
the problem here is, that it is only one in ten books that will connect with us.
When we stop on the ninth book,
we also stop growing up.
Standing still cuts Humanity with borders,
in the face of lack of wisdom we fall to self-deception, or fantasy.
And the first thing that deception and fantasy needs is reinforcement,
in desperation to make it as real as possible, we utter that horrible curse:
&quot;Mine is better than yours&quot;,
Be it color of skin, name of god, or country,
only more divisions will follow.
We divide in politics, medicine, neighborhood, opinions, rarity of cars, price of clothes,
and sometimes even the price of shoes, and whether or not we can really afford them.
Without wisdom, Humanity&apos;s collective vision becomes unclear,
and we begin moving in different directions, divided we will never find Peace.
Let us take to wisdom, let us return to searching for beautiful books and adventures,
may we grow, and converge on wisdom in our magnificent uniqueness.</span>

While we all know some English,
there is a lot those two have to say to each other.
One dreams about rebuilding the United States,
as The United States of The World.
The Other wants to look into every corner,
to be certain that mis-education is eating the world.
There cannot be dislikes here,
only Love and Understanding, in Wisdom.
Wisdom calls to Love,
Everywhere.
Without wisdom a Police officer will unravel into a thug,
with wisdom, disobey orders and protect those who fight for goodness.
Without wisdom, children made to become soldiers, will kill each other,
with wisdom, they will turn right around and look their fathers, and commanders in the eyes.
Without wisdom politicians will fuel tensions among the nations of the world,
with wisdom, they will immediately dismantle nuclear weapons and ban war, not just unethical weapons.
Without wisdom religious leaders divide the world and create open wounds that will never heal,
in wisdom, they will rise up against human rights violations and become popularizes of science and reason.
Without wisdom leaders will see criminals as &quot;needing to be brought to heel&quot;,
with wisdom, they will see children who never had a real chance at the good life.
Without wisdom, agencies claiming to protect nations will subvert democracy and destroy the nations they were sworn to protect,
with wisdom, they will respectfully prevent the unwise from gaining access to or remaining in positions of authority.
Without wisdom, Earth will be brought to a crisis that will cause mass starvation and call for population control,
with wisdom, businesses that contribute to the Anthropocene Extinction will have to close as profits have no meaning in a world without a future.
Without wisdom, governments will be blind to poverty and prevent generations of children from growing up,
with wisdom, money will be used to help people not erase their minds.
Without wisdom, broken children will become broken men and in poverty of mind parade the color of their skin, or hair as a sign of superiority,
with wisdom we will admire our beautiful uniqueness the wy we admire the colors of each others eyes.
The word Philosophy comes from Greek,
it means Love of Wisdom.
All wisdom is the same,
there is no bad wisdom, or good wisdom, just Universal wisdom.
Wisdom is special,
it is like an operating system.
Unlike a computer operating system,
wisdom independently emerges in sufficiently educated individual beings.
It is something that we are predisposed for, by Nature,
Wisdom is the next big step that Humanity must take.
Ineffective Education, and Education driven by propaganda or fantasies,
is hurting our progress forward.
Our education is a very delicate process,
fear of being held back, or bad grades, or being taught fairy tales or falsehoods delays our progress.
Poverty, homelessness, hunger, self medication, and violence,
prevents us from learning, and we cannot make out way towards wisdom in that state.
We have to protect the children from our lack of wisdom,
and help them to understand that the only way they can have a future is by means of Wisdom and the Love it entails.
We have to encourage children to become Great Beings,
and we have to admit that we can&apos;t fix the world because it is a multi-generational project.
The repairs that are required rely on increased levels of Honest and Real Education throughout the world,
no more noise, no more haste, no more grades or levels or division that render subjects incomprehensible.
A real school is marked by real results,
by helping all their students towards Real Wisdom onward to helping them become Great Beings.
Today, very few graduates can see value in retaking all exams that helped them graduate,
and fewer still would be able to get the grades that prove that school was effective.
We confuse our amazing ability to learn, with school&apos;s ability to teach,
and we suffer for it, most of us are tricked into thinking that we aren&apos;t that smart, but the truth is that the school isn&apos;t that good.
Do not let schools trick you away from Wisdom,
we are an important link in a chain that connect past to the future, we must aim to become wise and teach wisdom as the highest value.
The world will stand still when divided,
when united in wisdom we will rise.</span>

Personal Note,
I seem to babble on about many things,
but the first wrong that hurt me was school.
So when I think about helping the world grow,
the first thing that comes to mind is fixing it.
I am really worried about the ease,
with which we can be indoctrinated into false beliefs.
I mean we are all born into a world
with intercontinental ballistic missiles pointed at all cities.
We accept this all to easily,
most of us never pays any attention.
The mechanism behind our blind acceptance.
is also the same mechanism that may launch them someday.
To really see all the things we need to fix,
we have to wiggle ourselves out of any and all indoctrinations.
One of our most powerful superpowers,
is thinking by subtle analogy to something else.
That is one of the mechanisms that powers our wisdom,
we can see or solve problems based on other things we find in books.
There are three people that influenced my ideas about education the most,
Richard Dawkins, Erica Goldson, and the Saintly Sir Ken Robinson.
When I look at them, I feel like I copied everything from them,
but that&apos;s just means we are all fighting toward similar goals.
The thing that sticks out about me is this notion of wisdom,
I absolutely believe that we are all great thinkers that eventually become wise.
And unlike Sir Robinson who urges to reform,
or Miss Godson who want to work together.
I mostly want to encourage students to stop trusting schools,
and accept the responsibility for their own education.
I do not think that being bombarded by mixtures of lessons and homework,
is good for learning, I think it only induces cramming, and renders a student uneducated.
Sir Robinson mentions,
that there is a small percentage of students that do thrive in school.
But you see what Erica Goldson is saying,
she&apos;s is only good at passing tests, and she&apos;s scared.
Richard Dawkins is a scientist who urges people,
to focus on the The Magic of Reality, rather than any other magic.
The way he takes to the stage,
and the way he moves an audience.
His dignity and certainty of knowing-that he is correct,
and that he is helping the world grow, is an perfect example of a Great Being.
The title of this text,
comes from a question asked by a young [presumably religions] lady: &quot;What if you&apos;re wrong?&quot;
I urge you to look it up on the internet to hear his response,
and to see what a being hoping to help the world grow really looks like.
One of the most heartbreakingly powerful things that comes to my mind in regards to his work,
is him visiting a school where children are being indoctrinated into the belief that Noah and his Ark are absolutely real.
These children can&apos;t know otherwise,
it becomes their very reality.

                      <span class="text-muted">You must not allow your parents to use school as a babysitter,
you must not allow your teachers to trick you into memorization.
Friends and social life, are not an excuse to stay in a bad school,
grab your friends and transfer to something better, or learn on your own.
A bad school diploma does not get you anything,
it only shows people that they can cheat you.
On the other hand dumping a broken school,
and transferring to something that does show results makes a world of difference.
For one it will help you experience independence,
with a small measure of discomfort it will help your mind become stronger.
You do not want to work at a company that expect you to waste years on junk lectures,
your years are precious, each year must find you smarter, stronger, and wiser.
Rejection of pretending to learn,
and not following others will help you grow.
Finding lectures or books that do make you smarter and wiser,
will help you build your own company.
Schools are almost certainly completely broken,
they may be so broken that otherwise normal people may need dangerous medications to pass.
You must resist memorization, and merely getting good at passing tests,
because that is not an real education, that&apos;s just basic acting.
It is not enough to be in school,
or even to have good grades.
You must ask yourself if you are learning for real,
and if what you are learning is useful to you.
You must ask yourself if you are seeing real results,
if what you have learned had a positive impact on you.
And, you may not be able to find a school,
it is a real tragedy, we failed you.
Even if &quot;Fake it until you make it&quot;,
has already turned the world into a brittle cheeto.
There is hope,
the hope is in self-education.
The people who invented schools and those who made breakthroughs in science,
begun their self education with a single thread or a question.
They followed a single unbroken line of curiosities and answers,
start with survey courses in Science and Adventure.
To find your beginning search carefully amongst electronics,
art and sculpture or painting and music, computers, design, programming.
Find the start, get your answers, and rest,
and now resume from where you left off.
No stress here,
no hard work.
You may only need LEGO Technic and a Raspberry PI kit with sensors,
maybe a a book about UNIX and a couple of used cheap 3D printers that you splice together.
The only thing that you have to be mindful of,
is keeping a a small Research Journal and Building a Huge Colorful Portfolio.
In fact your portfolio should become one of the main reasons,
for becoming a Graphic Designer and possibly a Web Developer.
After all, you are capturing your pure joy,
and your path of self-education is pure pride.
This kind of coupling, where the want of a beautiful portfolio,
pushes you towards Design, and possibly programming happens often.
A personal &quot;want&quot; has driven many independent inventors before you,
difference between being taught, and reaching out for knowledge yourself is like night and day.
One takes you to enlightenment, and the other,
often times towards hating Mondays, waiting for Wednesdays and drinking on Fridays while you wonder if you hate your life.
It is likely that you will not be accepted to Harvard, not even Peace Corps,
but listen...
...what does an institution that expects you to sit through worthless mind numbing lectures,
matter to you, and what does that say about their values and ideals, and deans and the friends and experiences you will encounter there.
Don&apos;t bother with things that are not worth your time,
we have to find a way to fix the world.
We have to fix schools, we have to fix poverty,
and damn it, we can&apos;t go through our lives with atomic weapons pointed at our families.
Ideas like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD),
and banning certain weapons in war but not war it self really show us how young of a civilization we are.
Now we race for a High School or College Diploma,
by pretending to learn with memorization while teachers pretend they didn&apos;t force us into it for a paycheck.
And deans pretend they have no idea this is going on,
and for the mere stress of massive unforgivable student debt we can get a brand name education that recruiters will void their bowels over.
Oh, and not to mention the 13th Amendment where we can be sent into Legal Slavery,
by downloading the complete questionable works of Lady Gaga in mp3 format, or even just for participating in IPFS to host our own poems.
There is nothing that you will gain from not learning,
pretending to get educated is just the same as staying uneducated.
Spewing useless gibberish about Trig or powerhouses of the cell,
only makes people look foolish.
Not only that, but eventually they figure out they got tricked into cramming,
and now not only the look foolish - but heartbreakingly - start feeling it too.
For those of you who did get tricked,
please just listen to top rated Audio Books in the science, adventure, philosophy and memoir section, it won&apos;t take long to catch up.
That whole thing about not being able to learn fast because you are older is fake,
as you get older your bullshit meters get better.
It is just that you are no longer willing to waste your time on useless things,
that&apos;s why books work but re-taking the GED does not.
But do take it easy,
especially when you are young.
Learn to avoid troublemakers,
they are just children with aged faces.
And no there are no exceptions,
and no you are not meant to fill in the blanks for them.
The last thing you need is your husband deciding to smoke weed or become a drunk (or worse) 15 years into a marriage because it is now legal,
there is no excuse, no shortcuts in the world of lack of education, we neeeeeeeed wisdom, it is our operating system, it is our everything.
Our minds are so powerful,
it is so easy to inherit from memoirs.
When combining fascinating books with incredible adventures...
when you find your self atop of an ancient dune in the middle of a nasty storm listening to a life changing book, it all becomes clear.
You are underestimating yourself,
most of us have no idea how powerful we are.
Our only problem is that in the face of not knowing,
we can be easily mislead and follow useless paths for years or even decades, such as is the case with ineffective education.
So speak out,
don&apos;t follow, and don&apos;t be silent.
With the aid of your classroom friends,
make it clear to your teacher that you would rather study things that are relevant to you-personally, that enlighten your path and produce lasting results that you can build on.
Read books, begin your self education, and develop the skills necessary to express your concerns about the school just turning you into profits,
fill an auditorium, give speeches and talks in multiple schools; become a leader, an inspiration, a Great Being.
Do Not Follow,
Life Is Too Precious, and Your Wisdom Too Important.

and Spring will come a month sooner just for that reason.
Therefore, we are really just about 84 days away,
it is coming real fast even though today the sky was gray.
And since this was an extremely warm year,
we can be certain that Spring really is near.
I&apos;d say we are looking at just about 54 days in total,
and this is hard evidence, not at all, anecdotal.
But you know, as well as I do too,
that this Spring will be a meteorological breakthrough.
So all in total, give or take a day,

                      <span class="text-muted">Wisdom has many names and can be viewed in many different ways,
most popular perspective is that [non-academic] Philosophy leads to wisdom.
One particularly beautiful view,
hints on wisdom with the words Content of Character.
The most mechanically sound description is,
understanding new things by subtle analogy to what we already know.
The most concerning view states that,
without wisdom we will be making mistakes.
I think most reasonable view; is all of the above,
plus knowledge gained from Adventure, Philosophy, and Science Books and Audio Books.
What is it for?
Why, it is our Operating System.
PART II, Thought Experiment
Allow me to share with you a thought experiment,
a way of seeing things that aid in your view of the world.
Without wisdom, we form tribes and elect leaders, shamans, or popes,
and hire muscle, creatures of violence.
Because that is the same thing the other tribe is doing,
and the weaker one will be destroyed with great horror.
These tribal bare bone behavior did not end in middle ages,
as one would hope.
This behavior is the default human behavior for the frightened and uneducated,
the desperate, the angry, even the sick.
We may not understand why criminals do the things they do,
but we can imagine one of our family members, who one by one loses everything.
And on the last day, when all he has left,
is an ounce of sanity, and a beating hart, he will fight, steal, and hate just to live another day.
And for those who can&apos;t imagine why one would like to live another day when it is all pain,
to persevere memories, to keep the fallen alive.
And here we meet a Man of Honor,
a Judge, along with a jury, and wealthy lawyers in fantastic shoes.
And all they see is a mad man,
a criminal, a man who needs to be put in a cage.
The Judge is wrong,
when it comes to putting people in cages, all judges are wrong.
To restore this man, he needs a home, and books, and friends,
and an education, and hope, and reams, and free money, and free food.
He needs to be treated with love and dignity,
and granted an opportunity to persevere his memories in a book.
There are no criminals,
they are just broken children.
The ugliness of the worst of them is just an act,
they just want to be left alone.
And I suppose that evil men do exist,
but I don&apos;t think there is enough of them in the world to fill a single prison.
The 10,000,000 people we keep in cages,
are just children with severe developmental issues.
There are no political systems advanced enough to treat these beings,
their only hope is the Public Defender.
The Public Defenders will fight to keep the broken people out of prison,
because they know prison will only make them worse.
If you ever wanted to see a real Angel,
ask a Judge to let you sit in on a court case, look that tired being in the eyes.
We are Human Beings,
we are not animals to be kept in cages.
I have met snarling beasts,
and I saw their red faces and bulging eyes, and they were just broken kids.
At first I wanted my older self to come and help me,
but later I just started calling them My Bullies, they never had a chance at a good life.
And here we find a sliver of sanity,
because there is something that can be done to control crime.
It is preventing children from being forced into that desperate mode of existence,
PREVENTION.
Prevention is a simple thing, Free Home, Free Food, Free Money,
and Free Tutors, a Real Education.
It will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,
it is as simple as that.
No suffering,
no harm.
And for those of you who are crazy enough to ask who will pay for this,
let us call the institution a Bank of Love, right at the Heart of a Country.
They print only as much money as people need to be taken care of,
and they pride themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.
Prevention, is really about education,
because an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.
Social Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,
will grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can&apos;t pay for extras.
They&apos;ll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,
but not the boat.
Prevention will go a long way to bring the number of prisoners down,
these desperate beings are part of our family, it is all of us or none.
We are a young civilization,
we don&apos;t have governments that can handle Universal Basic Income.
We have governments,
that can barely handle themselves.
We can cross this bridge, the bridge where we eliminate poverty, and homelessness, and immense fear and suffering,
suffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don&apos;t burst out of pain.
To get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,
those of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.
Only in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,
beyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.
The youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,
but you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.
Treat the cause,
and the symptoms will subside.
Only in wisdom,
can our civilization advance forward.
Personal Note,
Those of you who are just learning about the world,
know that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.
Be it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,
they are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.
We are still building the foundation,
and we are getting too much interference from our leadership.
Look no further than the complete loss of privacy,
this is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.
Enhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,
the world has no faith in nations that practice torture.
The 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full
it reads &quot;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States&quot;.
You have a lot of work on your hands,
and you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.
While you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,
read them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.
In less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,
you will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.
It is in it self a great adventure,
and if I may, a Memoir is best written as your life unfolds, it is never too early to start writing.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Lack of education must be recognized as the highest threat,
to the security of our world.
We are not to force children into poverty,
by selling a mere impression of knowledge.
Privacy is to be recognized,
as a Basic Human right.
And those of you who hate, or just laugh,
know in no uncertain terms, that you will be forgotten.
The younger generations are sacred,
and they are to be honored by free and effective education.
They are to be granted privacy,
free acres to any and all educational materials and all books, including audio books.
Those of you who are looking to turn a profit,
by dangling education as a carrot, will be forgotten in disgrace.
Rest of my note,
is for the Children.
Know that parents are often victims to their cognitive biases,
out of lack of education, out of never having met a real teacher.
Know, with all certainty that borders are wrong,
they are a symptom of poison that our biases drive into us when unchecked.
The effects of our cognitive biases burn brightest and spread fastest,
when fueled by lack of education; poverty of mind and wallet.
The world of today is choking on chaos born from lack of education and wisdom,
prestigious positions are taken up by lying pretenders whose only aim is to fake it until they make it.
They are unaware of their lack of education,
they do not know what wisdom is, most of them just want to feed to no end.
Only in wisdom can the world become what it is mean to be,
one home, for us all, our entire family.
We are only divided by levels of education,
in Wisdom we are one, and we are each Unique and Infinitely Beautiful.
You are not so serve, you are the future,
you are to lead the world to unity and wisdom.
In poverty certain imaginary things spread in our minds like viruses,
they are fueled by fear, darkness, uncertainty and lack of education.
They become a beacon to those who like to frighten,
and take enlightenment away with threats punishment for no other reason than to tower and feed.
It your great responsibility to set yourself free,
do not be a slave to a cult.
You are meant to become a Wise Being by listening to and reading books,
and you are meant to become a Great Being by helping your loved ones and even some of your enemies towards enlightenment and freedom.
If a school is not teaching you,
then it is not a school, and you have to find a real one.
Do not become tricked by a mere impression of education,
you don&apos;t need a job, you need to be a business owner, and a leader.
We need you to stand as competition to overpriced medicine and companies that violate human rights for profit,
to corporations that cannot have hearts and slick talking psychopaths, who will never see value in helping you.
Especially those who announce themselves with,
with bite sized lies.
Build you own schools out of books,
may you share libraries.
May you build schools free of shame, judgment, pressure to cheat, and threat punishment,
or prison - which is what being held back is.
Share your wisdom amongst each other,
tell the world about your parents in audiobooks and torrents of videos.
Question poverty, question profit maximization,
and the betrayals of privacy, leadership, and even organized education.
The internet is for you to connect and see that we are all the same,
we all love your humor, and relish in and learn much your insults.
The internet will remain in place as we all wait for you to connect the world together,
we built it for you and we will protect it until you make the borders that divide humanity, irrelevant.
We fill and re-fill libraries with inspiration and wisdom to help you grow faster,
to help you gain visions with clarity that is not available to us - and it is working.
Always reject status quo and question authority,
especially their biases and down to their marrow until all they have left to speak is, that ounce of truth they do know.
Without wisdom, desperate men can only blindly-and-automatically, repeat history&apos;s mistakes,
those who have no wisdom have no authority over you, YOU ARE THE FUTURE.
We are to make Audio Books out of Love,
not wars out of incompetence, fear and hate.
Happiness is not something you can pursue, that&apos;s impossible,
nor life is a journey to some imaginary destination, we can only return to the nothingness we emerged from.
Happiness must ensue, and it will only appear in lives of wisdom,
it is not a feeling can capture and hold, it is a gravity that will overwhelm and lovingly crush you every day, forever.
The road ahead of you, is extremely long,
and requires hundreds of years of work.
But the future is beautiful,
it is more beautiful than any of us alive today can imagine.
Take to audio books on the subjects of Adventure, Philosophy, Wisdom, Science, Greatness and Growing Up, immediately,
and take what you learn to school, do not let teachers trick you into cramming and blame it on you.
The world is standing still, the sooner you stand up for Wisdom and deliver,
the sooner the future will come.
You are the teachers now.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Greatness is not a question of having it or not,
it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.
We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,
to save the world from mediocrity and hate.
All battles for goodness are already won,
and before you know it, your great task will be done.
But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,
set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.
You never really fight in a good war,
the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.
But Greatness will call to you non the less,
it will ask you to speak about Wisdom, Love, Growing Up, and Kindness.
You see many Great Beings smile when facing wrath,
that powerful joy comes from the certainty of walking the right path.
Those who walk the wrong path, age quickly and fade,
and history books will soon-enough reveal their charade.
The Noble Greatness within us all is forged to last,
and the opportunities ahead are as beautiful as vast.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Any adventure,
is an adventure.
You don&apos;t have to go far,
though walking will be involved.
Adventures within adventures,
are even more fun.
That&apos;s where you go somewhere,
and then explore something else from there.
It is like going to Ludington,
but then marching around Nordhouse Dunes.
Or visiting White Fish Point,
and then trying to find fossils on the beach.
Or even going to the mall with your friends,
and then just people watching instead.
One definition of tiny adventures,
is going somewhere and then learning something new.
But you see, in this modern age we live in now,
this is a lot more exciting than it sounds, because of Audio Books.
Though you maybe walking to the store for a change,
your Audio Book, may transport you to the Appalachian Trail.
There are other things that can spice up your adventures,
it all depends how creative you are.
For example, back in January 2014,
during the gorgeous -16 Fahrenheit Polar Vortex weather in Michigan.
With all the warnings as not to go outside,
and stay home, and drink hot chocolate.
I put on all my clothes, all at once,
and hurried out, for an hour-and-a-half-long expedition.
I wasn&apos;t in want for anything,
so I figured I might as well get some little beef jerky sausages.
It didn&apos;t seem as cold as everyone made it out to be,
but it did make my sausages; as frosty, as my little adventure fantastic.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Time for all of us to rise,
to fuel that which is greatest within us.
It is how we change the world with our works,
that matters the most in the end.
It is almost certainly a very small book,
one that will sit along side a smartphone.
And it is a book of answers,
that helps the children to real life.
Let us open our books
by undoing burdens:
&quot;Whatever trouble brought you to my book, child,
know that there are few people
that would have acted differently
in circumstances similar to yours.&quot;
And then carefully, let us share,
in the limited number of pages that we have,
what has moved us the most.
Without our hard earned wisdom,
they don&apos;t really have a chance at not making the same mistakes.
Who else is going to teach them if not us,
what Socrates said was only meant for the age he grew up in.
We need to repeat it anew,
nearer the culture of the children.
We have to help them understand,
that old age is a privileged denied to many.
So as long as we take to living in pursuit if wisdom,
and it is never to late to start, aging is a good thing.
Let us not have the children start at the same height we stated,
let us spare them the aches we went through, may our aches count for more.
Let us show the younger generations that we are rising,
that we are building a better world albeit slowly.
The world can&apos;t be replaced,
it must be transformed.
Just like a ship can&apos;t be replaced,
but can be transformed by updating it, board by board.
Let us show them that part of the meaning of their existence,
is a lasting legacy of wisdom.
The sooner they start,
the more beautiful their rise.
And the other part is Happiness,
out of Wisdom, out of Strength.
The meaning of life comes with Wisdom,
as our mind becomes more powerful for all the good ideas it gathers.
We have to help the children to understand,
that they belong to a Universal Culture, that they are Citizens of the World.
That all the things that change based on geographic location,
are but traditions.
Only that which remains regardless of where they are born,
is their true culture.
We have to get them to help each other as they grow,
to reach out to each other across borders.
The borders that dive us,
borders are just the products of small and primitive minds.
The future belongs to the children,
not those who gained authority by pretending.
There is hope for a more just and transparent world,
but it requires that we all stand in relentless pursuit of wisdom.
A liar will always win,
except when it comes to the wise
The wise will easily recognize the uneducated fool,
taking on his pleasing shapes.
Let us help the younger generations, to wisdom,
by telling them about Philosophers and their Love and Pursuit of Wisdom.
Let us pass on only the good ideas,
and commit the bad ones to history books as cautionary tales.
A life is a work of art, it paints it self day by day,
to create a beautiful picture, our legacy.
Life is best lived when what we learned yesterday,
adds to help us become a little bit wiser today.
The energy and the force for it all comes from
from watching our contributions help the world grow.
The new generations starting, not at zero,
but at the heights that we bought them to, by our own deliberate pursuit of wisdom.</span>

lets a stray ray of light in.
The light displays a blurry image,
of what is outside, a pin hole camera.
As the beam travels along the wall,
he can imagine the entire solar system.
He knows the planet spins and rotates,
by inference from Jupiter Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
And now slowly the light,
reaches an old crystal vase.
There is a rainbow,
the beam of light is unfurled.
He&apos;s counting the colors,
and a violin plays.
And A becomes Blue,
B is Indigo,
C turns Violet,
D is Red,
E becomes Orange,
F is Yellow,
and G glows Green.
He watched the whole thing,
in bed, in silence.
He knows now he will turn led to gold,
let the Clockwork Universe, Unfold.
You are so lucky that you live in an age where you can pull up,
Newton&apos;s book on opticks with the click of a link.
In most cases you can&apos;t be stopped by by research you have not yet conducted,
and you don&apos;t have to invent much from scratch, you just need a science book.
You have the same mental powers as Newton and all the others,
but you DO, have to slow down, and think about things just like they did.
Learning or catching up,
is an Art.
Even though you have all the answers before you,
you can&apos;t read it all at once.
You have to follow one thread at a time,
our minds need time to comprehend and rearrange.
Like the body of a dancer needs time to adapt,
we have to learn at a precise pace, and sequence.
It is very similar to learning the roads of a new city,
you never say to your self I am not smart enough to navigate.
Because you never listen to confusing directions,
you just follow a single road at your own pace and eventually master it.
See, Newton learned from works of Galileo,
who passed away the year Newton was born.
And although Newton never did convert led to gold,
the led of his pencil, became even more precious.
Many of Newton&apos;s works,
must have fascinated Henry Cavendish.
And Einstein no doubt appreciated the modes of thinking these men revealed,
even though he never figured out his Spooky Action at a Distance.
They all learned much along the way,
and each became wise for trying.

that we believe whatever we are born into.
It is such a terrible disadvantage,
and nobody, makes it known to us.
The study of Cognitive Biases,
should be first and foremost.
I wish teachers would speak out more often,
instead they are just pushing everyone through.
For one they get to keep their jobs,
and two, it is not their job to fix education.
It takes so little, to start learning on your own,
and it makes such an enormous difference.
Life becomes so long, and so cheerful,
and you can feel your self growing up.
Book by book, curiosity by curiosity,
all the dots connect.
And they will only connect,
if you are learning what you like or love.
If someone is making those selections for you,
then it is all just going to be disconnected noise.
At a young age it is all to easy to say,
education is not for me.
Similar thing happens in Academic Philosophy,
people simply say &quot;Philosophy is useless for life&quot;.
&quot;Academic Philosophy,
has no relevance.&quot;
Philo-sophia means Love of Wisdom,
but when it it taken into Academia...
When it is divided into subjects,
it loses everything, it becomes synthetic, and useless.
That&apos;s how you should view Education divided into subjects,
synthetic, and useless.
Real education is the thing that Great Beings granted themselves,
before standardized schooling became mandatory and cut up.
Build your own school,
book by book, adventure by adventure, curiosity by curiosity.
You have a powerful mind,
the constellation of stars within, is perfectly unique.
You are irreplaceable,
in every way.
Don&apos;t trust anybody to teach you anything,
just make your way towards books that move you.
In this modern age,
books are read to you, by professional narrators.
So as long as you slow down to give them a chance, you can learn,
from the Proudest Works, of the Greatest Minds, in the best of ways.
Teachers only care about the moment they are in,
but your life, will be long.
Your life will carry on,
long after school.
You need real education,
one that leads to real wisdom.
We can&apos;t go through life,
filled with disconnected knowledge that can&apos;t connect.
We need a self-reinforcing, integrated library,
of all the modern works.
You can only get that from modern non-fiction, or popular science books,
and especially when authors reference or thank each other.
A popular science book is a story about the science,
about the things that made it come into being.
Facts are the least that thy take away from it,
it is the stories of adventure, and modes of thinking that matter most.
Our search for wisdom must come first,
or we won&apos;t be able to tell real from fake.
Wisdom is fundamental to our decision making,
clarity of vision, is too important to trust others with.
It shouldn&apos;t matter where to to whom we are born,
there is just one reality.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Each day always starts with getting up,
except that, in the little wilderness you can&apos;t just roll out of bed.
At first, at best, you roll over,
to see where everything is at.
And although you can kind of lift yourself,
you can&apos;t really get up.
You sleep on the ground,
in a little tent.
That means you can,
only! stretch one limb at a time, and only a bit.
A successful decoupling and release,
requires great gymnastics.
The first order of the day,
is always fire, and a food item if you got one.
The trick to starting a fire,
is to start with tiny twigs that matches can light.
And then you add bigger, and bigger sticks,
it is absolutely required that you do a little dance.
The second order of the day, is adventure,
so you set off immediately.
Bring a day pack a water bottle,
if you are not sure where you are headed, follow the seagulls.
In my case there is this fantastic out of place bench,
right a top a dune.
One of the odd things about it is that,
it is about a foot too high off the ground, due to dune erosion.
To get atop of it, you must hoist a knee, and then kind of desperately roll in to it,
with an intense expression, and you realize that you haven&apos;t done that since your terrible twos.
Upon basking in the sun, the next order in the day,
is troublemaking.
On that particular day, I&apos;ve noticed two weary travelers by the parking lot,
sniffing the leaves of a tree, that they were eagerly attempting to identify.
I briskly walked up to them and said,
&quot;Oh my god, you guys, this is poison ivy, don&apos;t touch that.&quot;
One of the older ladies started making chicken noises at her friend,
and I waddled away.
To, my surprise, I discovered that this parking lot held a water pump,
I had no idea.
The fourth order of the day,
is the venerable search for a walking stick to continue the walk about.
This is no easy mater at Nordhouse as you can&apos;t miss the:
&quot;THIS IS BEAR COUNTY&quot; posters printed in Bold Comic Sans all over.
Any venture into the woods could potentially result in a dangerous standoff,
between a snarling man and a beast.
The fifth order of the day, at least for me,
is fossil hunting.
I have my collection right next to me as I write this,
though they all look like gibberish to me, some of those thing are prehistoric.
Fantastic!
It is a long walk to my favorite spot,
but it looks like a dune valley where you are surrounded by pretty tall dunes.
And here I cheerfully waddle back,
with a pocket full of rocks.
Back to my camp,
eyes still searching for fossils.
In the early afternoon it is good time to set off for the gas station,
here I usually grab a sausage and a couple of gallons of water, maybe a candy bar.
And the day slowly nears getting some more firewood,
sharpening a stick for the sausage, and waiting for the sunset to come.
At Twilight I prepare my Audio Book for the evening,
and crawl back into my fluffy sleeping bag.

                      <span class="text-muted">The first point of failure,
and our first hope for repairs.
Is focus on real education.
Schools are graduating students that they failed to educate,
these children grow into confused adults, lost and looking for belonging.
Why is this tolerated?
Let me ask you,
what would happen if we asked all the College Graduates to re-take all their tests from high school on?
Shouldn&apos;t people who graduated college easily show improvement to their GPA when re-taking all their tests?
Shouldn&apos;t those who graduated, but can&apos;t pass their test,
ask for a refund, or a lawsuit for having been tricked into an impression of education?
It is tolerance of these simple stupid problems,
that leads to made up lives of fantasy and eventual blindness towards evil.
If you can&apos;t pass all the college tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated college,
then you do not have a college education.
If you can&apos;t pass all the high school tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated high school with,
then you do not have a high school education.
If you can&apos;t pass all the middle school tests and get a higher GPA than the one you left middle school with,
then you do not have a middle school education.
Not only that, but the way these schools teach and the knowledge they drive into you,
may not be useful; you may not even have a useful education.
I think we can all agree here,
that we have a problem.
At the very least,
if your child has bad grades, don&apos;t make them feel bad, or unintelligent.
You should move them to a different type of school,
where teachers are interested in educated children rather than turning them into a paycheck.
The reason why it does not occur to parents that schools are not working,
is that they don&apos;t have experience with fake institutions, they take them for granted.
They are indoctrinated into a culture where school is good,
and being a worker is great, and it takes a particularly awful person not to achieve anything in life.
So what are those achievements?
How is all that retesting going?
The problem, as you can imagine, is much larger,
tolerance of fake education is just the beginning.
Above all,
Humanity must grow.
We are not allowed to tolerate Human Right Violations,
all human beings are created equal.
All must be granted equal opportunity to real education,
in a world that sets them free from poverty, and helps their bodies stay healthy.
Nations are not allowed to oppress their people,
no one has that right.
Nations have a great responsibility to help them to a Real Education,
in ways that will ignite a life long adventure across all sciences.
An opinion cannot stand against a fact,
that is a sign of illness, a small disorder born from fake-education.
And our dignity is such, that we must help each other rise,
we are not to tolerate anything that tricks people into believing in options over facts.
Fake education has been behind every evil perpetrated on this planet,
it is very much like a virus, it does two things really well, it spreads, and it reinfects.
Whatever beliefs are too hard to let go of,
we only need to place them in history or fantasy books.
It is wonderful to ponder Ice Giants and Greats Serpents,
but only as a fairy tale, or part of our growing up, not as a fact of life.
Fake education, unravels us,
it erases great strides made by great beings, and pulls the younger generations into dark ages.
The fantasies that bring us calm,
unravel the minds of the younger generations.
The reason we search for mere calm,
is that we ourselves, have been tricked out of real education.
All these confusing questions,
are easily treated with made up fantasies.
But that also serves to defeat the purpose,
of having a Beautiful and Powerful Mind.
It makes us weak.
Not a single Human Being is allowed tolerate
Concentration Camps, Abuse, Child Abuse, Racism and Xenophobia, or Inequality, Hate, or Fake Education.
Those of us who chose to relegate ourselves to a life of fantasy,
must also leave the table of public discourse.
Those of us who trade with nations that employ torture,
are not allowed to hold political positions, they simply can&apos;t, it is immoral to tolerate this.
Anybody who is delays Humanity&apos;s Progress,
contributes to Human Suffering, to all Suffering, Blindness, Misery, War, and Torture.
Our minds are extremely powerful,
and as they are allowed to develop, we will find unity.
We will agree on everything,
as we stabilize amongst each other in wisdom.
Government wise, there are no great disagreements,
there is only steady progress, forward.
On the individual level,
it is not that different.
Stress and anger, and sadness yield to Love and Wisdom,
even tragedy turns around a little bit.
With real education, we don&apos;t fall to pieces because something beautiful ended,
but we celebrate that it existed in the first place.
In wisdom, we seek a different class of things,
Nobler Things that come about as a result of our sense of dignity and real education.
No longer does anyone go home to a TV dinner,
suffering from depression, and fear, and loneliness.
What creates an educated government, a real government,
is prevention of sickness and poverty.
Nobody goes home convinced they are a worker,
or terrified of Human Resources, or or an uneducated &quot;Boss&quot;.
There isn&apos;t anybody who will argue against free medical care,
or universal income, or national debt, let it pile up.
The greater the debt that nations of earth owe to the universe,
the higher our level of compassion, empathy and development.
Money is just a job tracking tool,
on the government level it exists as an abstract idea.
You don&apos;t have to worry about Government Debt,
it is a good kind of debt, and it has no collectors.
Do you see?
Fake Education,
is tearing this world apart.
Fake Education,
is halting its progress.
It is neutering our minds,
it is turning us into workers.
It makes us ask stupid questions,
and parade stupid ideals and fake political labels.
We can&apos;t have a world without real education,
the dark ages will swallow us through the various tax exempt churches and imaginary gods.
Irrelevant worthless opinions will have us fighting for nothing,
because they are all equally wrong, stupid, and useless.
My friends,
pay attention to fake education, and everything will work out in the end.
We will find out way to wisdom,
we will converge on World Peace in our Wisest and Noblest ideas.
All you have to do, is make it clear to everyone around you,
that you will not tolerate fake education, that you are not on that side of history.
Write, Rhyme, Paint, Tag,
find your way out of fake education and whatever else is pulling you away from wisdom.
Hold up you path, and show them the results,
so that others may choose follow.
Real Education is marked by wisdom,
and it shows real results and contributions.
And though your hard earned achievements may already be great today,
your work is not finished until it brings permanent or lasting contributions towards our eventual convergence on Peace and Wisdom,
Every Human Being on Earth matters,
they are our family.
If you accept this great endeavor, many who fell prey to fake education may hate you in their own sickness,
but their children and the children of their children will grow up in a world transformed, in no small part by you.
We are one people, we are all meant to be Truly Educated in Our Beautiful Minds,
and we are all meant to live in safety and in peace looking after one another.
We are one people.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">As winter nears,
and snow appears.
You need not worry,
it is not end of Summers&apos;s glory.
Simply, look at weather, in Florida Keys,
no doubt it will be 83 or more degrees.
Often Georgia is also very nice,
and it is not too far, and may suffice.
Don&apos;t let snow make you fell lonely or sad,
because things aren&apos;t that bad.
Plus.
There is a couple more reasons,
for one, the equator reverses seasons.
And two, there are people that walk from Georgia to Maine,
from early Spring to Autumn they hardly ever complain.
Those are the Appalacian Trail Hikers of course,
beautiful, powerful, and as strong as many a horse.
From Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin they walk,
crossing every mountain, valley, woodland, and rock.
So if Winter ever makes you feel sad,
then it is time for change, and you should be glad.
Because, wintry sadness is a universal call,
a call for adventure, that rings in us all.
Whether you are only going to drive to Georgia and back,
go all the way to the Keys, or start shopping for a backpack.
Growing up is something that people who love you, want you to do,
they know that to thine own self, you must be true.
Our lives are precious and we are not workers of any kind,
we are dreamers and thinkers and we are not meant to live blind.
You are at your most beautiful when you are Happy and Strong,
so grab your loved ones and have them come along.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Though mighty, we are very delicate creatures,
our minds require Beauty and Calm to learn the most at their best.
Haste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,
homework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.
Learning for real, real education, useful knowledge,
thriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.
In real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,
doesn&apos;t actually do anything.
Reality, demands real things,
truth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.
A beautiful life,
requires our full beauty.
To bloom, to truly grow up,
we need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.
It is not as easy as it sounds,
though we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.
What about, the less obvious things?
Such as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,
but on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.
So you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?
that is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?
And what about the quality of that test,
and what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?
And what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,
in effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.
And what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,
what if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?
Reality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,
but you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.
At no point should you be pushed to the side,
and forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.
And do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,
spending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn&apos;t guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.
Now, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,
and eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.
So, High School, College, University and a Career,
does not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.
If you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,
you can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.
Just for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,
and zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.
Cults and religions are not the only indoctrination,
they are just the ones that are trivial to catch.
A Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,
but even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.
Even an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,
as you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.
Lets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,
is a sign that you are being taken advantage of.
Learning is not about memorization,
and memorization has nothing to do with learning.
Memorization is best used in poetry,
it a way to give thanks to poets.
Even if you memorize numbers of a new language,
all you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.
Memorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,
is almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.
To learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,
watch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.
We are good at language,
just like we are good at dance, don&apos;t force it, love it.
Your Knowledge is sacred,
it empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.
When someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,
you must become very suspicious of their motives.
The world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,
sometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.
You have to find a way to learn things right,
I think we all know, that way, is not the school way.
I know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,
but you see, that won&apos;t go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.
Moreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,
you become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.
It is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,
it is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.
The way to push back against manipulators,
is to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.
At most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,
though they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.
25 audio books is like a month of your life,
and, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.
You will always return to where you were as you read them,
so you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.
You can either start your life with a heart break,
or with adventure and audio books.
Grab your friends, tell them to behave,
and go together.
If I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,
as neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.
I found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,
it fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can&apos;t even.
Look for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,
and keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.
Use the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,
they are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.
That is all you need, to create an adventure,
a path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.
And promise to drive carefully,
you are not in a hurry.
Now, not everyone is ready to write,
but some of you are a lot further along than you think.
Begin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,
and that&apos;s it, don&apos;t press, flow.
Just like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,
and need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.
My friends, same goes for our minds,
fear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.
Do you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?
Impatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,
sadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.
These are not things that we can fix, you can&apos;t take pain killers for body aches from from fear.
By calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,
but it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.
In a way, psychology is a young science,
it is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.
There aren&apos;t too many answers here,
but there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.
The secret to a long and healthy life is:
Happiness.
I am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,
and get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.
Happiness is quite a thing,
it is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.
Where wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,
happiness makes you a powerful doctor.
The low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,
that will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.
Has the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,
and plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.
I once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,
and somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:
The Laughing Philosopher.
While, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,
I am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.
And I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,
or dragged away by a condor.
And I know for certain, that the saddest of us,
are the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.
All you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,
that the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.
Fight the urge to turn the car around,
that is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.
It will only take a few days,
and then, everything changes.
Oh my, when you get out of your car,
and your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.
By taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,
you can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.
And hearing your first chipmunk,
will absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.
No job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,
has any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?
You joy of life is sacred,
everything else has to be secondary.
You are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,
when you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.
Call it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,
but keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.
Because that will mark the rise of your own personal University,
and the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">School, wisdom, philosophy, job, university, career, writing, politics, adventure, grades, greatness, soul,
how can you tell which of these are real, outdated or just not worth your time?
By finding your beginning, of course,
and then weaving an unbroken thread that makes you rise.
We are born of chaos and accident, but we are a masterpiece of the Universe,
the time required to permute all combinations of chemicals to give rise to life is, long.
We are here, because as unlikely as life is,
eventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.
When you look around this planet,
despite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.
I think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,
but unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can&apos;t build cities of thoughts and dreams.
In a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:
rare.
In two words:
Beautiful and Rare.
We have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,
and see what we can weave with it.
In the misery of cold caves,
or the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.
In the dark ages of child labor,
or the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.
In the age of Mustard Gas,
or poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.
In the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,
Cold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.
But in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,
where what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.
We grew,
my friends, it happened just now, just like that.
A new way of learning:
Audio Books on The Trail.
No university lecture,
can beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.
Unlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,
or in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.
A professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,
but he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.
A memoir,
will.
All the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,
to books about the promise of World Peace...
And if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,
by contrast a Professor&apos;s smile is meaningless, if not fake.
Professors can only interfere with your development,
no single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.
While your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,
there is something else, you need.
You need a taste of Greatness,
you will never find it in a University town, never.
There is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,
those are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.
When you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,
in rain in snow...
...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,
I am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.
For how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,
by putting you into a little dorm room.
And no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,
to impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.
How could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,
than your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.
No professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,
as a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.
And the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening&apos;s bonfire,
that thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.
He wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,
but you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.
Let the trail,
become your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.
SPEAK OUT,
do not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.
SPEAK OUT,
do not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.
SPEAK OUT,
tell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.
Speak Out,
speak out.
In wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,
it is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.
The Trail,
and that thread, are one and the same.
And the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,
in cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.
After a few years,
what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.
A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,
and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.
Your own book,
will start.
And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,
and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.
That&apos;s how you will know what is real,
what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.
Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,
wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.
And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,
you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.
Take your self-education to the trails,
the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.
Don&apos;t worry, it will be OK,
so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.
And the last thing a Great Being discovers,
is the answer to their first big question &quot;Who am I?&quot;, it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.
Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,
and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Do you remember wondering about becoming an adult?
wanting to be done with this dumb kid stuff and have Ice Cream... even in winter.
Just being half pint is not that big of a deal,
it is the not knowing, what adults know, that&apos;s the hard part.
For some of us this is a book, or a manual, or the mystery of philosophy,
but what we are actually trying to picture is... Wisdom.
Even as babies we know that wisdom separates a child from an adult,
it isn&apos;t just about growing older, anybody can just age, it is about Wisdom.
Much of Wisdom comes from inheriting lifetimes of knowledge from books,
the problem here is, that it is only one in ten books that will connect with us.
When we stop on the ninth book,
we also stop growing up.
Standing still cuts Humanity with borders,
in the face of lack of wisdom we fall to self-deception, or fantasy.
And the first thing that deception and fantasy needs is reinforcement,
in desperation to make it as real as possible, we utter that horrible curse:
&quot;Mine is better than yours&quot;,
Be it color of skin, name of god, or country,
only more divisions will follow.
We divide in politics, medicine, neighborhood, opinions, rarity of cars, price of clothes,
and sometimes even the price of shoes, and whether or not we can really afford them.
Without wisdom, Humanity&apos;s collective vision becomes unclear,
and we begin moving in different directions, divided we will never find Peace.
Let us take to wisdom, let us return to searching for beautiful books and adventures,
may we grow, and converge on wisdom in our magnificent uniqueness.</span>
