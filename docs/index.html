                      <span class="text-muted">Each lesson must add to the next one,
we hardly need to push ourselves.
It sooo important that you start with something you like,
it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.
There area always extras that come alongside,
and they change everything.
Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,
maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.
Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,
you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.
I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,
but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.
Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,
it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.
A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,
sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.
One example that comes to mind is the Ohm&apos;s Law,
you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.
Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,
you can&apos;t connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.
So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,
then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.
Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,
you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.
You see what the problem is, of course,
in schools, they don&apos;t teach by means of practical applications.
They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,
which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.
If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,
and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.
But they don&apos;t do that,
we have to do that.
And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,
it is all those little things we are interested in.
And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,
they won&apos;t know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.
See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,
so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.
And then come our retirement, we&apos;ll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,
and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.
It is the only way the world can grow,
and there is much growing up ahead of us.

                      <span class="text-muted">That is the law, above all laws,
that is the rule above all rules.
That is the advice, above all advice,
that is the last sacred wisdom.
The adults can have whatever they want, and a full measure of happiness,
so as long as it does not interfere with your rise to greatness.
Whatever stands in your way, gods, royalty, governments and armies, laws,
traditions, parents, friends, schools, fairy tales, and curfews.
Is null and void,
by the power of the Universe, by the power of Reality.
Do you hear me?
all that matters is that you become a Great Being and Help Humanity Grow.
And armies will come to twist and lie, deport and enslave,
warp and punish, judge and sentence.
But they do not fight you,
they fight reality.
Those who fight reality,
can only destroy themselves.
You, you begin,
by inheriting reason and wisdom.
Whether you rise in camps, prisons or battles,
school libraries, or by shouting poems at the cafeteria.
Wisdom is the first and foremost,
and what must follow; is your rise to greatness.
Do not fear armies that are marching towards sure self-destruction,
instead Honor Humanity by becoming a Great Being.
And when you, reach your golden age,
remove that which stands in the way of the generations that are to follow.
Because, the world belongs to the children,
and the generations that are yet to come.
You must rise to Greatness,
by whatever means fit you best.</span>

the world becomes a darker place.
The bad people are sick and broken,
they only have as much power as you give them.
The more you grow in strength,
the weaker, they become.
Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,
we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.
The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,
the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.
The bad people are only broken children, they can&apos;t grow,
they do not know that a Human, can only rise, when hurt.
Humans are born warriors,
our minds were forged in battle.
We are also philosophers,
each of our hardships, becomes a breathtaking page in our memoir.
No ache, ever goes wasted,
it becomes sacred and inspired wisdom to help others rise.
The only way for Humanity to grow,
is for each and every Human to become a Great Being.
Your struggles are a call to Heroism,
become a teacher, and help Humanity learn.
Greatness, is the new adulthood,
Greatness, is Humanity&apos;s Health.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">When you think about life decade by decade,
you can see that it is best lived by following an upward slope.
Each decade should be powerful for us,
it should propel us forward and beyond.
We must really take the time to consider what is important,
what is it that our elder selves may regret not having done.
Life does come with an instruction manual,
it is all the Audio Books that will interest you.
From Memoirs, to Adventure, and Science,
and also reading in-between the lines.
Above all, we must take good care of ourselves,
life is not meant to be lived in stress, or fear, or at a great speed.
This is how we can understand those books,
and learn from them and inherit their wisdom.
We are each a miracle of the universe,
the GPA, the championship or scholarship, just does not matter.
Listen to those words,
IT DOES NOT MATTER!
Because you are already more,
than any of that made up stuff!
It is not the brand of education that matters,
what matters, is that your education, brought you wisdom!
With wisdom, if you still need to,
you will build your own Firm, or Company, or School.
Pursuit of Wisdom, guarantees that as each decade passes,
you will grow in Greatness.
With Wisdom, and the transcendence of limits it entails,
come our golden age, we will become far more, than we thought possible.
The most prestigious degree, is the honorary degree,
where a University goes out of its way to deliver it to you,
for all your achievements, and the goodness you brought to the World.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">You are more than a student, or employee,
you are more than what you have, and even more than your dreams.
But oh my gosh, it is so easy to forget how special we all are,
fall to daily routines, and carrots and sticks and stones.
Two weeks of vacation for a little adventure is not enough
to push stress back and remember how beautiful we all are.
We have to try very hard not to lose ourselves in work,
in stress, in deceptions, in toxic situations.
Listen, just because you CAN - if you go all out to get that promotion,
or GPA, or diploma, it does not mean you should.
Because, you MUST make room for Sunshine, and Starry Nights,
for little adventures allover the place, and then some.
Your well being is not to be sacrificed for any reason,
no matter who is telling you that you must, must, must!
No, just say no,
and go.
Go, on the worlds most perfect adventure,
one that lasts a long time, and starts with a tiny shopping expedition,
But also carries on for days, maybe weeks,
a visit to every antique store along the way to buy the cheapest but cutest thing.
So cute, that NOBODY will question you needing it,
but so CHEAP, that everyone will say &quot;Oh wow, it is already old!&quot;
And then make expeditions to get ice cream,
and sausages, and why not buy a White Chocolate Cookies And Creme candy bar, why not in deed.
And continue on, mounting expeditions for fossils, and minerals,
a lighthouse, a beach far and yonder, chipmunk photos, and firewood.
All the while, remembering, and sometimes discovering,
who you are, where you are headed in life, and what it will be like when you arrive.
I... like driving at night,
because it seems safer.
I pack my gear in the afternoon,
I make sure to have water and some canned goods.
I wait until early Monday morning,
2AM or so, connect my GPS and go.
It takes about 3.5 hours to get there,
I always listen to the The Four Horsemen Discussion couple of times.
I discovered the Ludington State Park,
by just following highways and big roads.
It is really easy to get there,
take I-275 North, and follow I-96 West they kind of connect with an arc.
Then after hours and hours,
then take exit 1B to merge onto US-31 North, that takes you to the city limits.
Then when you run out of road,
take a left on US-10 that will take you in to Ludington.
Please drive carefully,
try to bring many friends along.
I always arrive early,
so I take a small nap in the Meijer parking lot.
Upon my awakening I go get some Ice Cream,
and shop around for Fanny Packs.
And, I always make sure to have mosquito sticks,
the thick ones that you light on fire, watch for that ash if you try to move one.
You drive west through Ludington,
there is a huge parking lot and a beach like no other.
Please ignore the signs that say &quot;DO NOT FEED SEAGULLS&quot;,
they are starving and need all your breadcrumbs.
I always watch sunsets, but when I parked at that beach, got ready, and put my sunglasses on,
some cute couple started making fun of me for how seriously I take the whole ordeal.
Perhaps it is just better to keep slowly driving north,
towards the State Park.
I always do, my office is there, for one,
right on that little parking lot when the dunes start, it is, a good view.
I remember one time I caught a nap there too,
waking up to an endless horizon was quite an awakening, that for sure.
Well you know how it is, State Parks are not free,
and it is best to book a Jack Pine Hike-in Site ahead of time.
As you keep going north, you can pay on the left where the campers go,
or you can just keep going and pay by the gate.
Park, disembark, and get ready to haul everything to your hike-in site,
watch out for owls.
Once you are there, set up camp, get some squeaky water out of the pump,
and get all the firewood you can find.
I always bring a hand saw with me,
I don&apos;t mess around when it comes to firewood.
And then hop over the dune,
there is a paradise out there, and you have to build something out of the drift wood.
The little lighthouse in the distance,
that&apos;s the Big Sable Point Lighthouse.
They sometimes hire people to work in their gift-shop,
and apparently give them a little apartment up there; sounds lonely to me.
Every time you come back from a little adventure,
and see that &quot;JACK PINE CAMPGROUND HIKE-IN SITES&quot; sign, it will feel like coming back home.
Jack Pine is a wonderful place,
aim to stay there a month if you can.
Move from site to site,
stay a day at the State Park, shower and come back to Jack Pine until you had enough.
Finally, when it is time to leave Jack Pine,
grab a pine cone to remember it by, and head to Nordhouse, just for a day or two.
They have a metal box you slip a few dollars into to get a parking permit,
and you&apos;ll have to hike a bit to get to the Wideness area, but it will be worth it.
It is so beautiful, that you may wish to stay longer than a couple of days,
you can walk the woods via Arrowhead Trail, or take the beach.
Watch for breaks in the grass,
that usually means there is a neat campsite out there.
Jack Pine will always feel very welcoming,
Nordhouse is a bit wilder.
You will have sand in your gear, and car for months,
hopefully to last you a whole winter so that you may get a refill come spring.
I say the Nordhouse sand brings good luck, and good memories,
when you are stressed out in a hurry, and notice there is still some sand left...
It will put things in perspective,
take you back to your latest camping adventure for a moment, help you slow down.
And above all, remind you to tidy up your gear,
give that old tent a sniff and see if you need to order a new one.
Before you know it,
it will be ample time to head on out there again.
One of the healthiest things we can do,
is sync up with the sun... go to sleep at sundown and get up at sunrise.
Another is to always make sure,
we have plenty of room in our life to read or listen to books.
And most importantly, Nature,
the bird song,
the chipmunk squeaks,
the crisp air,
the rich woodland fragrance of moss, fern and bear,
the building of a fire,
swimming in the lake,
exploring ancient dunes,
aimlessly collecting fossils and cute pebbles by the beach,
watching a beautiful storm in the distance,
searching for arrowheads...
...suddenly popping into the nearby gas-station to get more ice cream and sausage,
and then getting back to the camp, for another long and starry evening,
and slowly falling asleep, just to wake up to a another healing day.
Never forget your dreams,
never forget who you are.
Never, overwork yourself,
just because you can it does not mean you should.
We are far too beautiful to treat ourselves cogs in a machine,
we are meant to grow, and bloom, and inspire, and move entire generations.
We are so good at learning, and understanding, and mastering knowledge,
that past a few books, the undiscovered country beacons.
We are a young civilization,
do not let that push you around.
You are to discover your path to becoming a Great Being,
and help the world grow in Wisdom and in Peace.

                      <span class="text-muted">Books and Audio Books,
are as important to us as food.
But many of us can&apos;t get into them,
and there is a reason why.
Many lives are lived at a speed,
that makes books hard to follow and understand.
We lead busy lives,
and majority of our time is spent in haste.
Haste brings us relief from,
anxieties and confusing questions.
Part of the reason why haste,
brings us relief.
Is that there is less time,
to be bothered with things we don&apos;t understand.
This is the reason why many people, come their golden age,
feel, that life was a lot shorter than they expected.
In a word, haste blocks us,
from experiencing our lives in full.
Books hold all the answers that will address anxiety and confusion,
but they require that the person exists the state of haste to understand them.
As we read, comprehend, and inherit more and more,
we&apos;ll hold enough answers to learn to live without the need for haste.
To slam the breaks,
we need a change of scenery.
Section hiking Appalachian, of the Pacific Crest Trail,
comes highly recommended by many great beings.
But any kind of long adventure,
where you have to go to sleep come sundown, will do.
Even before you decide where you are headed,
even before you get your backpack out.
You will be able to see,
how easy it will be to absorb your audio books as you walk through the woods.
Both your body and your mind,
will begin transforming.
What was once &quot;just moss&quot;,
will not become a precious sunlit dew world.
Fern will now paint the world around you, perfectly hiding beautiful secret springs,
little furry creatures, damn angry bears, and other woodland treasures.
At twilight you will have to go to sleep,
you&apos;ll awaken full of energy just before sunrise.
The scent of a green morning,
the sound of nature.
And then the books will start calling you,
maybe it will be &quot;A Walk In The Woods&quot; by Bill Bryson.
Or it could be &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;.
by Carl Sagan, or &quot;The Partly Cloudy Patriot&quot; read in Sarah Vowell&apos;s amazing voice.
It will be nice, and relaxing,
it will be impossible to put down.
And then,
something you didn&apos;t expect will happen.
See, whatever your next big step in your life,
that internal transformation that your soul is ready to leap to...
It has already been described,
with Love and Passion in a book somewhere.
Within the first ten books you are bound to find,
the first one that deeply will move you.
It will connect with you, extend you,
integrate with you, help you leap forward in your development.
Within days you won&apos;t even be able to remember,
what came from the book and what was already in you.
It will change everything,
it will restore you completely.
And so your search for the next life-chaining book,
and the next adventure, will begin.

                      <span class="text-muted">The only thing that divides Humanity,
is levels of education.
The more educated we become,
the closer we come together.
With real education,
comes wisdom.
Humanity is destined,
to come together in Wisdom and Peace.
To hasten our Convergence on Wisdom,
we must accept the responsibility for our own education.
We are each perfectly unique,
there is no such thing as a standard human mind.
We must choose our own books the books we enjoy,
and walk the path that fits us best book by book, at just the right pace.
A book is a stored wisdom,
where our body needs food our mind needs books.
Books accelerate our intellectual development,
books are inherited best when read by a fine narrator.
It will take a hundred books to find the ten we need,
and poetically speaking our mind will merge with their wisdom.
We will become wiser, more compassionate,
more authentic, stronger, calmer and more creative.
While looking at ourselves we see the common Humanity,
we are more than that.
When the younger generations look at us,
we are a call to Enlightenment, to Inspiration, and Knowledge and Wisdom.
Who we are,
is where all the world&apos;s children follow.
Let us delay no more,
and take to books right now.
Let us help those who have difficulty reading,
by helping them to narrated versions.
And let us not forget,
that Greatness calls to All Beings.
Therefore, let us all become Wise and Great,
so that the Younger Generations may follow.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Fake schooling and the resulting lack of education,
not only hold us back and propagate misery but will destabilize a nation.
But the problems are far more complicated,
for one there are very few real criminals, most were just warped by lack of school.
Real schools, have the ability,
to prevent a person from committing a crime.
On top of that, upon committing a crime,
if prisons were turned to special need schools, we could help almost everyone.
Real schools are not that complex,
plus they can use poverty to their advantage.
By presenting students with a way out of poverty that fits them,
the students will be put in a position where they will want to learn particular things.
That&apos;s how real education works,
it is not about tests an memorization, but need, imagination, triumph and challenge.
Be it a misguided voter, a desperate student, or someone blinded by fear and anger and poverty,
schools are all there really is, it is the greatest hope and dream.
What we call a school today, is not a school,
it is a collective fantasy that hands the teachers a paycheck, and the students a diploma.
Our cognitive biases make it so that we go along with it,
there are people out there who hold up a diploma they crammed for and truly believe they are an engineer.
This is probably similar to when a person commits a crime,
they say &quot;This is is this is where I finally become free&quot;, but that is only cartoon reality.
A college diploma does not mean that the student is educated,
and when deans are pressed they will say, &quot;We discouraged cramming&quot;.
And when everyone is pressed to own up,
the mother of the boy who stole,
the engineer&apos;s professor,
and the engineer and the student,
and that so called criminal,
the men who approve textbooks,
those who pray to fairy-tales in hopes of saving nations they mistakenly destroyed,
and the prime ministers, and royalty,
popes and cardinals,
and the congresses, and the president,
and the men who nearly destroyed this nation by the practice of &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;,
and those who ignored climate change and might have done a lot worse than torture,
and those who are glad, that we all forgot,
that we have all pointed intercontinental ballistic missiles at each other,
all the major cities, all of them, every family, every future.
All they will say is this:
&quot;I was JUST following orders.&quot;
&quot;I JUST didn&apos;t know.&quot;
&quot;HOW was I supposed to know?&quot;
This is what fake education results in,
this is the &quot;fake it until you make it&quot; pattern of behavior.
The solution to it all is books,
books that those of us who are good at narration,
read for others who aren&apos;t very good at reading.
Teams of students, ganging up together to record books, with laughter, and foolishness,
and dammit, sometimes adding whole new chunks to them, to make the dry parts more interesting.
And sharing, with everyone,
everywhere.
Laughter is the ultimate seal of authenticity,
that something is worth our time.
Once the world awakens to the realization that students should make the lectures,
driving them with collective curiosities and inspirations, and sharing them for free.
Kids will want to watch them,
they will want to see what happens next.
Can you imagine a set of lectures by students working to bring back Pixel Art Games,
lectures on the subject of Color Theory, Trigonometry, Calculus, Music Composition, and even woodworking for the arcade cabinets.
Can you see what having that full vision do to a young mind,
how inspiring it is to see the classroom succeed in turning out, one game after another, and making a pretty penny too.
Real schools combine with reality,
they are both an introduction to the real world and a future extension of it.
I know that all of this is a lot to take in,
it is a description of the biggest of our problems,
and the middle of our solutions.
The beginning is much simpler than that,
the beginning starts off like every superhero origin story ever told.
You build up your power,
you armor.
You pick up your first book, your second book, your third book,
Metamorphosis, Walden, Cosmos, Into The Wild.
Sagan, Bryson, Thoreau, Kafaka, Krakauer, Kant, Nietzche,
Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, and countelss others.
With each book you hear, you inherit you inherit the wisdom of the author,
just like that, straight up data transfer,
and re-listening to the same audio books or lectures makes them even more powerful.
It takes a few years to take it all on,
but before you know it, your own idea synthesis kicks in.
You&apos;ll be able to feel the world,
and feel the fear of the fakers, and pretenders.
You&apos;ll be able to see the paths of change,
that the world needs so that it may continue growing.
You&apos;ll be able to connect, restore, repair, and resume,
the thoughts of all great beings from across all the ages.
Your intelligence is not set in stone, it is flexible,
your mind is there to help you become more and more intelligent.
The more you know, the faster you learn more,
and the wiser and more intelligent you become.</span>

and slowly learning Philosophy, Sciences, and Art.
It is easy.
It is what the modern non-fiction is all about,
just, grab an audio book and go all out.
Hey, you don&apos;t need any reasons,
to become a connoisseur of the Seasons!
In Autumn, only read about Mother Nature,
and modern Adventure.
In Winter, focus on Philosophy and Art,
so that come spring you are always chipper and smart.
In Spring, you must absolutely read about Inner Strength,
mostly memoirs just to see how a human can go to great length.
In Summer, read or listen about our History,
how countless great beings fought for Unity, Wisdom and Glory.
The world is worthy of our love,
we should each transcend out limits, high and above.
We must all reach for knowledge and wisdom and awake,
forget leaders we can&apos;t ever know if they are true or fake.
We are one family, one world, one nation,
and the only thing dividing us is lack of education.
It is really hard to see,
how powerful Knowledge and Wisdom can be.
Maybe, think of it as knowledge received,
from lives you have not lived.
Once we all take to wisdom, real education will become first,
then we&apos;ll unite, and take down all the nuclear missiles that have us cursed.
Only then will we know,
how far is humanity able to go.</span>

and it is also the might with which every hero rose.
There cannot be a united world without a wise voter,
systems of politics can&apos;t work like a motor.
Corruption comes out of most people wanting to appear smart,
but their incompetence does not end when they depart.
Not only are they replaced by more of the same,
but the policies they set continue wandering without an aim.
Systems as such expand until they seize and fall,
then from the ashes can only rise a wall after wall.
It is because pretenders when pressed can only pretend more,
liars can only destroy a nation and lead it to war.
A nation must first help its uneducated, poor, and weak,
because poverty prevents people from learning and makes the future bleak.
Then, to power a system the voter must be educated and wise,
otherwise they can only contribute to the system&apos;s demise.
We cannot hope to build a peaceful nation,
if we do not begin with functional and real education.
Cognitive biases alone,
will corrupt a politician down to the bone.
But their real curse is such,
that they can&apos;t know, that they don&apos;t know very much.
Fake it until you make it, is not a driving force,
it is a mode of being rotten at the source.
Alas, we are too beautiful to allow politicians to sell it all,
we will turn our heads away from their madness and their fall.
A day will come, when they call for their wars,
but we&apos;ll be too busy, tearing down walls, and opening windows, and doors.
The future generations should look towards the internet,
building a world united by a peaceful mindset.
A world build far and above geographic borders,
one that is connected by Education and Compassion, not just orders.
But, we cannot Unite - without Wisdom and Schools,
today we do not yet have the necessary tools.
Non the less, the symbol of the Withe Dove,
will continue waiting for Humanity to unite, in Wisdom and Love.

                      <span class="text-muted">Myths were invented to describe amazing people,
and I&apos;ve seen many amazing creatures in my journeys.
One time out in Nordhouse,
out of nowhere popped out a freshly graduated engineer.
He held up a gallon water container that was carrying back to camp,
and the poor mad lad uttered, &quot;8.34 pounds&quot;.
He seemed excited, but also sad,
and I think he was acting so odd because he realized he was forgetting everything.
Plus, I am certain he said pounds,
not kilograms; mad in deed.
Another time, at 6am or so, I was going through maps of south Pacific,
in Ann Arbor, by that strange black metal cube sculpture that squeaks when rotated.
I just had to get away from Ambrosia&apos;s morning clientele,
bless their hearts.
And I&apos;ve noticed that across the park some student was sleeping under an evergreen,
I don&apos;t think she worked in US, I just somehow assumed South America, Amazon.
She stared getting off the ground, and tried to yell that she wasn&apos;t homeless or drunk,
I kept looking into my maps, ignoring her; and she went on her way to get a grant, or give a speech or something.
I am sure she worked in South America,
probably with the natives.
Over in Ludington, there was this one time a little girl was feeding Seagulls with her mom,
and just as I noticed the commotion...
one of the Seagulls,
went, all, out!
Right in her hair,
I felt so bad, and her mother was only barely able to contain her laughter.
She puffed up her face as if playing a trumpet,
you could totally tell she had enough of that kid, and she was getting payback for all her hissy fits.
And then there is this... story that is most Dearest to me,
one of my happiest memories, that I swore I would never talk about because I am far too mature.
Alas, this is what All Hallows&apos; Eve is all about,
talking about strange creatures, and wonderful memories.
It was an beautiful early morning,
I was sitting by my breakfast fire.
Mostly listening to birds, and probably angry bears,
whilst squiggling in my journal, about poems, and programs.
This was a large and beautiful camp site full of tress,
they had clean showers, and proper restrooms.
I had the first camp site on the Orchid Loop,
and I noticed that a couple of giggly middle aged ladies were just getting into the spirit of camping.
They were always happy, and sophisticated,
and laughing, playing some smart radio station, and always full of joy.
This morning the tall one started shimmy shammying first,
she was probably getting around to starting up a fire to make breakfast.
They had all the firewood,
and swe was singing something, it was unusual for people to make so many happy little noises during a stay there.
She quieted down a bit,
and lit her fire.
And as she bent over to pick up some twigs to get things going,
she fired off that old familiar sound that one would expect from a constipated and uncultured, filthy, lactose intolerant old man.
And, oh my gosh,
all of a sudden all the birds went quiet.
It was just this unusual deafening silence,
and that&apos;s just half the story, because all of a sudden this sophisticated wealthy woman goes:
&quot;Puull my finga&quot;
In the worst fake southern accent she could possibly conjure up,
and with the longest drawl.
And then she quickly skedaddled back to her camper,
- probably to change, and lay down a bit.
This must have been ten years ago or more,
and I still haven&apos;t forgotten about it.
Happy Halloween,
Everyone.

                      <span class="text-muted">Some secrets are right there,
in the sand, they lay bare.
For a few days,
I, manned that blaze.
I lit a fire so great,
that it moved me, to create.
I didn&apos;t have much in my tent,
in my wallet, I didn&apos;t have a singe cent.
I lived in a castle, built by a gigantic dune,
its halls hummed that ancient tune.
In the day I&apos;d gather firewood,
come the eve I&apos;d have a potato, that tasted so good.
I neither searched for a beginning nor the end,
I merely wanted to find idea&apos;s edge, to my own content.
It was right there,
but it was not in the horizon, nor the fire&apos;s flare.
It was in living at a proper pace,
and sleeping in the right place.
The pace at which you live your days,
must match your interest, and remain, in phase.
Composing Music and Painting Art,
are unique and worlds apart.
In art we race to paint,
but in music we must practice restraint.
The eye can&apos;t see,
what the ear can hear.
Though both require layers to become thick,
paintings rain, while music goes tick by tick.
Each requires a different place,
and a walk about at a distinct pace.
There are many out there that move all wrong,
sadly, they will never finish their painting, or their song.
And when it was time go back whence I came,
I rolled up my tent, and put out the flame.
Somebody else down the trail, instantly lit another fire,
and pondered their own wisdom, to their own desire.
I waddled back, my painted walking stick in hand,
slowly marking notes, beats, and measures in the sand.
Now, whenever I try to learn something new,
I wait for time to give me a clue.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Invent everything,
we are all extremely smart.
We can learn anything,
so as long as we don&apos;t skip any steps along the way.
And so as long,
as all steps are interesting and fun to us.
Never force yourself to learn something you don&apos;t enjoy,
just keep reading books, and keep looking for something to strike your fancy.
From Dreaming, and Inventing,
to Art, Programming and taking to the skies.
An invention can be as simple,
as an LED Throwie or LED Glowie.
Just a Light Emitting Diode, a battery and magnet,
to keep it all together; and as a bonus make it stick to metal surfaces.
That is a three component invention,
LED, magnet, battery.
My favorite Radio Astronomer,
Seth Shostak.
Quips, that the baseline for determining if a member of a species is intelligent,
is whether or not it can hold a soldering iron, and make a radio.
Allow me to get you soldering a radio,
as quickly as possible.
Get a Raspberry PI Zero W (the W stands for Wireless or &quot;with WI-FI&quot;),
a soldering kit, a solder wick, some GPIO headers,
and a 4 x 8 RGB LED HAT that fits a Raspberry PI Zero neatly.
Look everything up on YouTube,
how to solder, how to solder headers, how to use a solder wick.
This is serious business,
in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.
Though get a $30 kit
that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.
At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,
and set it up on the network.
But later as you figure everything out,
you unplug everything leaving just the power.
To get inside it,
you use a remote terminal.
Once you login,
you get a command prompt.
It listens to words, to commands,
very similar to adventure games.
Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,
are very much like rooms in a game.
To get inside Documents,
type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;
The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,
Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.
When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,
you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.
The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,
just a couple of words and nothing more.
But sometimes, that is not enough,
like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.
We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,
we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.
You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,
it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.
To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,
which is short for list, or list files.
&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,
you can ask it for help like above.
But also ask it to list files in a long format,
by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,
the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.
To list files with readable file sizes,
you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;
Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,
the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,
you just use the short versions.
The command line interface is trying to be your friend,
it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.
There are many tutorials on how to use the command line,
and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference
Here are instructions on how to play audio through HDMI,
your monitor should have an audio out somewhere.
Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,
and try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights based on this tutorial.
Alternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on this instructable,
note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.
And there is also a Raspberry PI WH,
meaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.
And now, get a $10 camera,
and use raspistill to take a photo,
and play around with all the other options.
Now you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,
a programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.
You can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,
you can get an LCD screen and turn it into a tablet.
Raspberry PI is not the only Single-board computer,
PINE looks really nice as well.
If you are looking for a more complicated project,
perhaps try building a Raspberry PI Drone,
bonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.
We have no limits,
but we are also very unique.
Our inventions need not rely on commuters,
some of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.
Don&apos;t let anybody stop you from inventing,
and don&apos;t stop dreaming.
Finally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,
make for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.
Aim,
for the Moon.

                      <span class="text-muted">Of course, it is not just aging,
but is it also more than just learning.
Some say &quot;Lean into the discomfort.&quot;,
others &quot;Don&apos;t try go all the way.&quot;.
It is all about building ourselves,
layer by layer.
The layers,
need not always be on the same subject.
You may start an artist, or a dreamer, or a mechanic,
and then move to urban explorer, photographer, and islander.
The steps we take are slightly different,
from what we take away.
An artist learns the harmony of colors,
the strange simplicity of desaturating colors by mixing opposites.
The dreamer learns that a dream is not just a dream,
because if you snag on it and carry it out, it will become true.
The mechanic learns about a screw,
if you tighten it too much you will ruin it.
The urban explorer learns that the attorney,
that left his stuff behind was always suffering and died alone.
The photographer learns that it is the journey,
and the photo is a mere bookmark in memories.
And the islander,
ohh, the islander.
Finally, when the golden age of wisdom and endless aches and grunts comes,
the islander learns that life is to be lived fully.
And what that means, is that we take what we learned from the day before,
mix it with today, and get it ready to mix it with tomorrow.
Like a waterfall that runs into to the ocean,
the new things we learn add to the body of the old.
With old age being a privilege denied to so many,
the treasure we carry truly becomes magnificent as we move forth.
We can&apos;t learn all at once,
and we can&apos;t fully learn through synthetic means.
At schools the curriculum is so warped,
it can only be dishonestly memorized.
Audio Books and Lectures, go a long way,
so as long as you make room for the lessons within.
Education requires room, here there can be no stress from grades,
no craziness for a high GPA, brand name education, and a promise of a job.
We need life, we need the full thickness of life,
and then an urge to study will emerge.
That thick life,
will move us.
It will uncover an absence of knowledge,
and it will feel great to fill it right up with precisely 14 books on the subject.
A synthetic education born from being forced to learn,
is a very poor education.
Memorization,
is not an education at all, it is actually dangerous and stupid.
And networking with grads from a brand name university to get stuff done,
has nothing to do with getting educated, it is a service trading club.
Learning from books,
whilst walking a huge trail filled with Bobcats and Mountain Lions,
is far superior of a teacher than anything claiming to educate today.
And one of the best things about books,
is that they make mistakes sometimes.
Their authors get so inspired,
that their ideas sometimes take off and fly in the sky.
And when you catch a famous Author on such a flight of fancy,
you learn even more, you learn about Excellence.
(And how useless, and desperate, and child like book critics are.)
Medical Schools are not an exception here,
textbooks are important, practice even more,
but so is healing a person on the inside, within their mind.
We can all imagine an excellent doctor, extremely professional,
perfect grades, well read, awesome person all around, no complaints.
And we can imagine what it is like to suffer without hope,
and seeing this kind individual, just move on to the next patient.
See, being a perfect Doctor, is not enough,
the surgery is not over when the procedure is done.
And people can tell when someone merely follows etiquette,
and merely pops in for a moment to say something nice, and be done with it.
Be it a Doctor, Scientist, Musician, Artist,
Dreamer, Adventurer, Rebel, even Beloved Professor...
...more is needed.
Greatness of heart,
is a really good start.
But, I think the golden standard of Life and Art,
is; Vastness of Heart.
There is no describing it, but these Beautiful Beings,
smile, and laugh, no matter the weather,
And when they speak, they seem to be part of Cosmos,
not just Earth.
A Mechanic who borrows from his work,
for purposes of Wisdom.
Will hold up a screw,
and say.
&quot;In order for this important piece of the system to do its job,
you have to know when too much of tightening the screw will damage it.&quot;
This is a good example of what we see in schools,
Elementary is a Dream, Middle School kind of works,
but creating High School by just making subjects more demanding, is insane.
The screw is tightened,
damaged, and now, it cannot be repaired.
At the very least, we must help the children to create a start-up,
to work together on building 3D printed inventions, learning Linux, and coming up with new stuff.
And help them setup a way of charging customers,
a way of advertising products, and wipe their fears of poverty.
The kids, are always smarter than us,
they build on top of what we have built.
We are not giving them the tools for their future,
we teach pure Trigonometry and this cannot be dumber.
Because to teach Trigonometry,
all the teacher has to do is create a class about
building games that get published on Steam (game store).
What a teacher may not do,
is force feed pure triangle garbage to people who don&apos;t have an interest in it.
It is not hormones (and no teacher should ever say that), students simply stop listing,
when they figure out the teachers are... selling them out for a paycheck.
Dreamers are my favorite,
here is someone who sits down and thinks up the following,
&quot;If I was born on a different continent,
to a different religion, I would be asked to worship that other god that I am told is false.&quot;
&quot;Furthermore,&quot; - and you know there is always a furthermore,
that&apos;s part of the reason why they cannot be stopped.
&quot;Aren&apos;t we all atheists,
to all the other gods.&quot;
And just when you think she was done with it,
she adds &quot;Why don&apos;t we go the extra step and love All Life, All Wisdom, All Good Ideas, and All Human Beings&quot;
And the next thing you know,
you realize she was never a Dreamer, nor was she ever little.
She&apos;s a Philosopher.
To tell children, that there exists a group of Universal Beings,
that dedicate their lives and immortality to Wisdom,
and passing it on to all the future generations,
is to help them grow from the highest of mountains.
And the Urban Explorer,
they see homes after the families left.
They see pictures,
and smiles, and forgotten hopes.
They see passage of time,
they see the motion of generation upon generation.
They can see the homes as they were on Christmas,
and they can read the medical bills scattered in the corner.
These so called scoundrels,
often chased away like dogs.
They are working on wording a lesson,
that they hope to voice some day.
Maybe come their golden age,
as Guggenheim shows their works.
They will speak of leaving bad ideas behind,
and sharing in all the good ones.
How truly precious all our daily chores,
how it is these little ordinary moments that add to create almost all our lives.
&quot;There are no ordinary moments&quot; as Dan Millman says.
Layer by layer, and the sequence will come deep from within the heart,
and it will reveal it self by means of curiosity.
When a day comes, and you find yourself looking out the window,
with more pleasure than than writing games or interactive fiction,
or managing your corporation, or putting out fire tornadoes.
Deep from within your heart,
a new curiosity calls to you.
And it can only make you better,
better at what you do, help you climb higher than the height you are on right now.
You don&apos;t have to switch careers,
but you do need to throw a loaf of bread into your back pack.
And hit the trail.
If you are out east Section Hike the Appalachian Trail,
if you are out west than hike the Pacific Crest Trail,
if you are out in the Pacific then set of for the Kalalau on the island of Ka&apos;uai.
Bring your Audio Books,
and make no mistake,
Because the end of that trail,
marks only the beginning of your new adventure.
Remember the aim, my friends:
Vastness Of Heart!</span>

there is something you should know.
Put on your mittens, and a hat,
and buy a big bottle of suntan lotion right where you&apos;re at.
But don&apos;t drive back home, just turn south on 275,
and drive.
We&apos;re going all the way down,
to take care of your frown.
You&apos;ll drive through Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
right till you get to good old Georgia.
Here you stop, and get some sleep.
but wake up early, cause we got a pace to keep.
Drive all the way through Florida to US Highway One,
and be ready to catch some sun.
Get to Little Duck Key,
and park beneath a palm tree.
Now, squirt some suntan lotion.
and enjoy the Ocean.

                      <span class="text-muted">Our cognitive biases,
will only keep causing trouble for as long as we are unaware of them.
Eventually, new, fully functional educational systems,
will help us to Knowledge and Wisdom.
As we learn to trust computers,
we will learn to stop relying on easily corruptible career politicians.
The educated voter democracies of the future,
will stand as powerful machines helping us manage our cities and Earth with the wisdom of the crowds.
The world before us lost 99% of its species,
the climate is ever changing.
The layer of oxygen we all rely on is extraordinary thin,
and most of earth is Ocean and the rest requires that we protect ourselves from elements.
While we are bound to this planet chemically,
Earth never really relied on us for anything.
We are not the destroyers, not is Earth,
we are simply yet to be fully awakened caretakers and maintainers.
We need a more powerful educational system,
one that reaches deep into all corners of Humanity,
From Yawanawa, Romani, Maasai, Samoyeds, Rotumans, and Hawaiians,
we all have to come together now as a single family.
What must connect us, is education,
which is just a path to Knowledge and Wisdom.
Whoever we are, and whatever we think we are doing,
we are made much better by inheritance of Knowledge and Wisdom,
which in turn begets Compassion, and Empathy, and the very cure for our Cognitive Biases.
The Love of The Human Family,
and the Insight and Understanding it entails.
It is OK to have made mistakes,
it is just our cognitive biases,
and lack of education, and poverty, and fear.
But it is not OK to stay within the confines of those mistakes,
Earth needs our help, the animals need our help too,
and we can&apos;t help them without Education and the Unity it entails.
All it will take is Storytellers and Lovers of Science and Knowledge,
and Narrators, reading it all in the many languages.
May this century,
become The Century Of The School.
A tiny Audio Player, perhaps a solar powered School on a Chip,
or free access satellites that truly bring the internet to all.
We don&apos;t have to Love All Humanity at first,
just the Tigers, the Big Pussy Cats, 3,890 left,
let us come together now, let us help Earth and all of her inhabitants.
And where education leads,
the nations will follow.

                    <span class="text-muted">Each lesson must add to the next one,
we hardly need to push ourselves.
It sooo important that you start with something you like,
it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.
There area always extras that come alongside,
and they change everything.
Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,
maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.
Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,
you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.
I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,
but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.
Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,
it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.
A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,
sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.
One example that comes to mind is the Ohm&apos;s Law,
you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.
Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,
you can&apos;t connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.
So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,
then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.
Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,
you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.
You see what the problem is, of course,
in schools, they don&apos;t teach by means of practical applications.
They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,
which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.
If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,
and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.
But they don&apos;t do that,
we have to do that.
And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,
it is all those little things we are interested in.
And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,
they won&apos;t know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.
See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,
so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.
And then come our retirement, we&apos;ll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,
and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.
It is the only way the world can grow,
and there is much growing up ahead of us.

that is the rule above all rules.
That is the advice, above all advice,
that is the last sacred wisdom.
The adults can have whatever they want, and a full measure of happiness,
so as long as it does not interfere with your rise to greatness.
Whatever stands in your way, gods, royalty, governments and armies, laws,
traditions, parents, friends, schools, fairy tales, and curfews.
Is null and void,
by the power of the Universe, by the power of Reality.
Do you hear me?
all that matters is that you become a Great Being and Help Humanity Grow.
And armies will come to twist and lie, deport and enslave,
warp and punish, judge and sentence.
But they do not fight you,
they fight reality.
Those who fight reality,
can only destroy themselves.
You, you begin,
by inheriting reason and wisdom.
Whether you rise in camps, prisons or battles,
school libraries, or by shouting poems at the cafeteria.
Wisdom is the first and foremost,
and what must follow; is your rise to greatness.
Do not fear armies that are marching towards sure self-destruction,
instead Honor Humanity by becoming a Great Being.
And when you, reach your golden age,
remove that which stands in the way of the generations that are to follow.
Because, the world belongs to the children,
and the generations that are yet to come.
You must rise to Greatness,
by whatever means fit you best.</span>

the world becomes a darker place.
The bad people are sick and broken,
they only have as much power as you give them.
The more you grow in strength,
the weaker, they become.
Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,
we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.
The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,
the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.
The bad people are only broken children, they can&apos;t grow,
they do not know that a Human, can only rise, when hurt.
Humans are born warriors,
our minds were forged in battle.
We are also philosophers,
each of our hardships, becomes a breathtaking page in our memoir.
No ache, ever goes wasted,
it becomes sacred and inspired wisdom to help others rise.
The only way for Humanity to grow,
is for each and every Human to become a Great Being.
Your struggles are a call to Heroism,
become a teacher, and help Humanity learn.
Greatness, is the new adulthood,
Greatness, is Humanity&apos;s Health.</span>

And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished. The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen. We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses. Nietzsche Viktor Frankl State of Mind INVICTUS - W. E. Henley Francine&apos;s Interview </span>
