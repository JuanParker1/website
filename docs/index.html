                      <span class="text-muted">Knowledge has an enormous impact on decision making,
if you don&apos;t know enough you maybe taken advantage of.
You gain knowledge by means of authentic education,
an education that has maximum impact on your existence.
Memorization or cramming is not an authentic education,
it is not any kind of education.
You don&apos;t want to rely on a doctor that memorized everything in school,
professionals must look things up to keep up with changes.
Memorization is only good for two things,
passing tests, and getting you ready for a factory job on an assembly line.
And on the other end, tests are for teachers to keep their jobs,
and principals to keep getting funding.
You have to make sure that you are not getting sold for a money,
that you are not being used to sustain an outdated industry.
And above all, do not let them trick you into thinking yo are not smart,
we are all extremely smart, we are all, without exception extremely good at learning for real.
The problem is with schools, they are trying to use a single teacher,
to teach anywhere between 30 and 300 students.
There is no way that a teacher can handle that,
so they will make up tests so that majority passes and damn the rest.
Memorization is just a temporary circus trick,
make sure you are learning meaningful things that have lasting impact.
Real education will multiply you,
fake education will make a fool out of you.
Decision-making is one of the most important things in life,
we need Real Education, Real Knowledge to help us make correct decisions in life.
Many of the decisions we make early on,
have long term impact that continues for decades in not for life.
It also matters that we grow up in an authentic culture,
if we are surrounded by lairs that too will contribute to push us off the path we want to be on.
You must ask if perhaps the school industry is using outdated teaching methods
that barely worked during industrial revolution, to keep getting government money.
Every student in every country,
from middle school to university must to check if they are really learning for real.
Real education is one that enriches a person with Knowledge gained in previous generations,
real education provides many lifetimes of knowledge in a beautifully arranged bouquet.
In turn, that Knowledge grows in you as its components become your own building blocks,
and help you to become Strong, Happy, Wise, Beautiful,
and eventually help you become a Great Being, one who makes lasting contributions to Human Kind.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Real Education, makes you, more you,
it greatly enhances your all predispositions.
No one has the right to hold you in contempt for your talents,
no one has the right to tell you who you should become.
All pursuits of excellence lead to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,
the longer it takes the more precious the result.
Ignore the so called teachers that will try to control you, or sway you off your path,
their only wish is to make their own lives easier even if it means sacrificing who you are.
Real education is somehow completely misunderstood,
and people do end up getting lost in life.
For example, some may enjoy a single subject,
and fall behind on all the rest.
Then, to fix their grades,
they are made to focus on fixing subjects that they are bad at.
In the process they interrupt themselves,
they are made to interfere with their own, more-real education.
And, here the beneficiary is the teacher and the dean,
and the reward is eventual raises for keeping GPAs stable.
Long after these frauds are gone,
their victims suffer, never having found a comfortable place.
Sometimes, even after the fools are gone people continue feeling guilt for their talents,
they become convinced that doodles are dumb, and poems are stupid.
It is hard to find happiness in doing things that we don&apos;t care about,
it maybe impossible even.
A life void of happiness,
is a life of depression and constant anxiety.
Even the smallest of our predispositions will develop into unique greatness,
a greatness that is hard to see at first, hard to reason about.
Let me make this clear, Real Education is not about getting a job,
it is about becoming a Great Being, who has much more to add.
And some people,
are a little bit ahead of their time.
For example kids that like to fly drones,
may never fully get into it, unless...
they get access to drones equipped with cameras,
that they can steer through a VR helmet, as if they were piloting them.
If they stick with it,
they will enter electronics, mathematics and software development.
If they get bored, or can&apos;t afford the hardware,
then they will lose something of themselves.
Rule of thumb here,
is to take a predisposition all the way, at all cost.
Hobbies or silly interests are gateways into sciences,
and should always be honored and seen as something very special.
One massive problem is the teachers and parents,
who when lacking similar predispositions will tend to destroy talent.
And they do it because they don&apos;t want their kid to stick out,
they don&apos;t need the extras and the questions that come along with them.
They may say that games are for children,
and talents are useless.
They will say such things because they can&apos;t handle life,
as someone took their talent away and now everything is cumbersome and more than they bargain for.
Coupled with organized and standardized schooling
that divide subjects into meaninglessness and noise that can only be memorized.
Sprinkle in some bullies,
that hate kids that stick out.
All that on top of already bad grades,
as the student may not even be aware that everyone is just memorizing.
And much is lost,
and most permanently.
Real Education is a source of joy, strength,
and contributes to love of life.
The effects of real education
are hard to describe.
It is the different between a pop star, and a girl forced to repeat the semester because she used to like music.
It is the difference between,
a quickly forgotten politician and a famous philosopher that continues to inspire generations.
Between a writer that dabbles in forgettable romance novels,
and one that helps us to understand a strange world of tyranny without tyrants one that we must reject.
Real education creates beings that change lives,
their Works come out of Greatness, nobly fueled by Wisdom and Knowledge.
To deny the becoming of a Great Being is to deny Growing Up,
it means to deny joy, happiness, and love of life.
Everyone is acting as if Greatness and Great Wisdom is rare,
all the while they are stopping each other from a Real Education.
It is Real Education that brings people into areas of Knowledge that they are predisposed to further,
granting them Wisdom, and eventually Greatness.
People who conspire against talent,
are Guidance Counselors, Teachers, and Parents, precisely those who are meant to encourage it.
We must honor the talents and predispositions of the younger generations,
by building personalized educational systems that lead them to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
We must remove all barriers that stand in their way,
the future of the world is in their hands.

                      <span class="text-muted">Just because the world is being tardy,
it does not mean you should be too.
In deed, if you fail to slowly make haste,
then the world will become darker for it.
Every Human must shine,
with Enlightenment.
I know it is hard to accept
that schools may not be working.
We all have so little,
and now even more even rugs are pulled from beneath our feet.
There is other stuff too,
from bad parenting to mutually assured destruction.
I am sorry, if you are looking for answers,
the best answers any of them will ever give you is: &quot;How were we supposed to know?&quot;
A solid foundation in reality is a good start in life,
sometimes we don&apos;t figure things out until it is too late.
I know this poem caught you early,
you have a long time to ponder all this.
And that too is a good start,
a proper Gentlelady or Gentleman questions everything, and takes nothing for granted.
I hope you are still in Middle School or High School,
and you get to walk to your desk, with a heavy step.
Slouch, perk up your ears like a Lion,
and take the whole situation apart.
The kids in the back figured it out already,
but that is as far as they got, they need more answers.
They need you!
the leader.
Maybe you can try thinking about debates,
learning from the way Great Beings argue the pretenders or the uneducated.
You are already given reasons,
now you need to find the truth.
It is never too early,
to begin to question everything.
One of the smallest arguments we are given, is the argument for mathematics,
well, it used to be given, it was that we aren&apos;t always going to have a calculator on hand.
Though it is cute to say that we have smart phones with calculators that have advanced mode,
there is a darker side to it.
Mathematics is not enough,
we need Programming, and we need to be Shell Literate as well.
Vapid and Insipid Mathematics poisoned the beauty of Science,
memorization of formulas obscured the simpler beauty beneath.
Memorization is another problem,
look how carefully you are nudged to abandon reason and understanding in favor of memorization.
The guillotine of failing a class because you tried to learn everything,
instead of passing with a straight A+ for merely cramming for the test - DOES chop your head off.
Look how proud your teacher is, that disingenuous show of teeth,
up for another raise, sold you for a paycheck and on some simple memes that you can get from a calendar.
One of the biggest reasons given to you,
is that you need a Diploma to get a Job.
I would like you to consider, that perhaps a real diploma,
is one that a University goes out of their way to give; you for your Great Achievements.
The diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,
while it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...
...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,
the best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.
Your life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,
there is no Life Arithmetic.
The closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:
Each life is more important than the other.
If someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,
you quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.
If the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,
then you are going to need to try harder.
In case you are wondering,
- I care, and you can&apos;t undo that.
The harder, or the less worn path,
is that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.
And you are not going to be the first or only one,
find the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.
So when someone says &quot;Diploma&quot;,
you reply; &quot;Check Your Premise&quot;, to quote an old friend.
When they say calculator,
you say: &quot;Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.&quot;
When they box you in to memorize,
you get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.
While governments are smart enough to encourage learning,
as evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.
I suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,
in that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.
But you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,
a government can&apos;t easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.
The way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,
is to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.
Self education is not that outrageous,
that is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.
And let me underline that interference will destroy self education,
grades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.
Self education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,
and instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.
Finally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but &quot;Free College&quot; is not quite right,
it should be &quot;Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results&quot;
Compare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don&apos;t need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,
we need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.
You should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,
a good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.
The thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,
as that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.
All you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,
and a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.
And then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,
find a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...
You will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16&quot; Bowie knife (don&apos;t do 14&quot;), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...
and a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.
As you read more and more,
and things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.
Bring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,
one with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.
Later on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,
fool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.
Though I highly recommend section hiking at first,
and also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.
You know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,
and that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.
And that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,
you do graduate ever higher.
I think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height
- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Mistakes and Misunderstandings divide Humanity today,
noting can be done because varying levels of education interfere with unity.
One of the biggest mistakes is ineffective education
tricking students into believing that they are educated.
Mis-education, fake education, ineffective education makes us blind,
truths and facts are drowned in an ocean of conflicting and equally wrong opinions.
Real education, is the key to unity, to a common grasp on reality,
but all the roads there are obscured by confused and confusing chatter.
It is not until we accept the responsibility for our own education,
that we will start learning, for real.
The biggest mistake is borders,
groups of wealthy uneducated people coming together to decide the futures of their nations.
These men claim greatness,
and hold up their experience as their proof.
But experience is no substitute for wisdom,
on the surface experience makes a person indistinguishable from a wise one.
The first clue to distinguish the two, is found in length of vision,
when they get around to speaking of problems of today, they will give excuses that they know - from experience - will hold up.
But they will dismiss the future entirely,
because to speak of the future; a person needs a direction, a vision, an objective, a purpose, a wisdom.
Men of experience, are too small minded, too blind and limited, to shallow, to fragile,
to see into things that have no impact on them.
Our levels of education are insufficient to directly address the problems that we face today,
there are too few well educated, knowledgeable and wise beings to repair anything right now.
An uneducated voting majority is all to easily swayed and misled,
and our poverty will prevent our generation from re-learning.
One of the worst things about general poverty,
is that it induces a poverty of mind, out of lack of time, out of stress, fear, and discomfort.
Reality, has no borders, as climate change and pandemics show us,
in reality we are one human family.
And in reality, poverty is tearing the world apart,
it is keeping us weak.
In reality, a teenager in a dictatorship on the other side of the world,
is your friend, they would love you if you sent them popular snacks from your city, some photos and music.
They are family,
there are people out there who would be genuinely kinder to you than some of your own family.
It is sooooo sad that we label each other with the names of our nations,
and return to tend to whatever poverty we are facing at the moment.
Internet, student exchange, programs like Peace Corps,
and documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights help us see in our confused state.
But it is just a tiny sliver of light,
poverty of mind alone is almost unaffected by it.
United Nations has its hands tied,
without an appropriate level of education General Assembly will stand in a constant state of disagreement.
Without a plan to unite, and eliminate poverty,
we are all equally wrong.
And we can&apos;t have Unity and Prosperity without Knowledge and Wisdom,
liars would instantly invent something that they stand to lose, and tear the world right up.
Do you hear me, do you see what I am saying,
we are one, it is all of us, or none.
The way to fix it,
is by inventing educational programs that really help children to knowledge, wisdom and greatness.
Because until we hold long term visions fueled by Knowledge and Wisdom,
the only thing we can agree on, is what the liars want us to believe in.
Real education is the thing that leads us to have thoughts independent to what is on TV and in News Papers,
it helps us see who the liars, and mark my words for this sorry year, even when they assume a pleasing shape.
Real Education grants us Intellectual Independence,
where audio book by book we all independently gain a valid grasp on reality.
Organized education will always bend under the threat of being defunded or kept in poverty,
it will help to invent brand name institutions that are only better in the name, but all equally ineffective.
Organized education will rip talent out of children, it will sand it down until they are all equally lost,
mixed with poverty most parents won&apos;t even be granted the ability to care about what is happening to the minds of their children, because the babysitting is good.
Organized education ends up causing harm to children&apos;s intellectual development,
it holds them back and causes so much stress that it is impossible to learn.
Organized education is such a problem, that even the best minds of our generations,
are still thinking about &quot;Free College&quot; - about paying those fraudulent institutions - instead of funding ones that are capable of Real Education.
Things are pretty bad, thankfully, we are infinite in our capacity to deal with real dangers,
especially the ones that tear tear our family apart.
Real education is based on students&apos; predispositions,
and curiosities.
For example, when someone is interested in the moon or stars at night,
that marks an entry point into Science Fiction, Astrophysics, Astrography and if they continue to care, Optics, Mathematics, Physics, Writing and so on.
Most children won&apos;t care for stars very long, because they are interested in exploring all of the universe,
and that is even better because then there is a multitude of passage ways they can use to walk through the sciences.
But it has to be their own walking, their own direction, and at their own pace,
we have to honor their predispositions and curiosities, the students are the future.
We have to remove grades, tests, graduation, class rooms, time divisions, subject divisions, rows of seats, groupings of any kind be it age or area of study,
we have to replace the teacher with personalized learning and tutors.
And we have to give the students what they need, a telescope, a fast single board computer with all the sensors and servos they could ever need,
they need the ability to launch satellites, to operate small remotely operated submarines and small drones, they need access to things they are curious about.
If a student is walking the wrong path, then it is a path that has been been walked many times before, they are asking a question, and they need powerful answers,
they have to see what war is like, what prisons are like, what concentration camps are like - and what love is like - and they will learn.
At the time of writing this in 2020, I realized that there are three nations that operate concentrations camps,
which is probably to say, that there are many; and they need to see that too.
They need to see gang violence, and if they are still around then meet up with Father Gregory Boyle&apos;s boys,
for they have surely become Great Beings.
Nothing goes wrong in real education,
real education is about reality, about really growing up, and really being human.
And when these students grow up, become voters, Senators and Congresswomen and Congressmen,
then the liars, and pretenders, will lose their hold on humanity.
And then the members of General Assembly of United nations,
can finally have their day, in agreement and unity.
My friends,
never lose hope.
If something important can&apos;t happen today,
it only means that you are to begin building the bridge, for others to eventually get there.
Real Education is the first step,
the second is actually many overlapping steps that will happen all at once, all around the world.
What you have to do is make sure that the students get to own or hold in their own hands the many tools that they need,
to learn, and explore the Human Condition, and The Sciences, and The World, and The Stars; as those are their countless bookmarks and the steppingstones to their boundless steps.
The children want to learn,
and that is all the hope Humanity will ever need.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We expand our horizons by adding new experiences and reading new books,
doing new things, going to new places, and challenging ourselves with new adventures.
Our predispositions, life experiences, existing knowledge, what we do and where we are,
our curiosities and triumphs as well as failures, choose what comes next.
The expansion of horizon is a poetic way of indicating growth,
increased cognition, enhanced instinct, and out limitless and ever enlarging body of knowledge.
A poetic way of describing predispositions,
is a compass with a finely tuned needle.
Though rare, sometimes predispositions are about negative experiences,
for example being smittened by all the things the Army Recruiter lies about at the Mall.
Underestimating the beautiful Appalachian or Pacific Crest Trails, is another example,
it is better to section hike a little bit at first, some take many years to section hike the whole thing.
But you know, as our horizon enlarges, even a tepid military experience can translate to greatness,
working with governments to protect endangered species from dangerous poachers is one beautiful example.
Following our compass, and expanding our endless horizons will transform us,
our predispositions will bloom like fields of wildflowers, colorful, unstoppable, unbreakable, endless.
And here I must state, in no uncertain terms, that I believe that,
following a compass needle that is set by somebody or something else, will deeply hurt us, send us into sadness and regret.
We all start with a tiny and wobbly compass,
and the littlest of horizons.
Perhaps a penchant for disassembling favorite toys, and an impeccable library of all the outstanding places that are somehow unusual,
from a cracked spider web filled WWII bunker to every river bridge that you can get under and get filthy from.
We have to cake care of who we are, and become more of it,
because that expands our horizon in the most magnificent of ways.
The dusty bridges turn to dusty trails,
toys become your endless computer programs.
You become an adventurer,
and an artist, and then so much more.
I suspect, we will run out of road,
if we follow an alien path.
You are filled with gentle and unique predispositions,
that will bring you great wisdom when examined.
Until you do follow your dreams and arrive at all the shores that call to you,
you won&apos;t really know what it is that you will become capable of, but it will be something far greater than you can image.
A great horizon, a great library of knowledge that helps you reason about new things by subtle analogy to what you already know,
takes you beyond one word guesses of wishes like lawyer, soldier, or doctor, in to the world of Presidents and Prime Ministers, Peace Makers, and Scientists that further Human Kind.
And if it so turns out that the world is not yet ready for who you become,
then you become a part of a bridge that aims to cover that gap, or restore something that has gone lost.
A President that the world is not yet ready to elect will work to help the world grow, a Peace Maker will aim to remind the world we are one,
a Scientist that does not yet have the necessary tools and research, will work to invent them for those that are sure follow.
We must listen to our hearts, to our curiosities and learn to no end, look how much more you are than the child you once were,
that child could not have grasped the complexity of your being today, and you today, cannot grasp the complexity and beauty of your wisest self... keep learning, and keep following your own dreams.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Culture switching is the best way to learn, it is about discovering that not only one&apos;s own culture is fluid,
but also, that there is no standard culture, just a colorful bouquet.
I think most people assume that switching cultures
means living in some other country for a but moving around is just as good.
The point is not to be glued to a single spot,
but continue adapting to as many as possible.
Moreover, changing the way we live is just as good,
spending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail is the most powerful example.
Above all, going to sleep when it gets dark, and rising to watch the sun rise,
is a great treasure, that brings great heath and strength.
Going forward every day, and slowing down to match the pace of nature,
helps people have long thoughts and connects all their dots together.
Discomfort, is not part of learning and growing, or healing,
it is just that we must not succumb to fear and imaginary dragons.
Doing new things is not perfect, but it is not discomfort,
discomfort is when someone is hurting you, or life is crushing you.
These are the situations that require drastic changes,
not just a set of changes, but a long term series of changes.
Some people, presumably at-least armchair psychologists,
say that we end up using a more logical side of our brain...
But, I am sure that our brains are infinitely more complex than that,
and what is actually going on is that we are leaving a kind of depression behind.
One of our main missions in life, is to live it to its fullest because, life is precious,
and that includes living in balance with nature, wisdom, and universe.
And while, I do admit that this sounds a wee bit hokey,
the best way to personally explore ideas behind heath and balance.
Is to try to imagine our elder selves,
at say, 85 and a half years, young.
It is hard to deny that, no one is more connected to the elder you, than you right now,
you can try to project your predispositions and try to imagine what the elder you is like.
Our energy is found in balanced living,
we have to move away from stress, and depression, and overwork.
Our intelligence, and creativity, our memory, and ability to learn, and read books,
requires that we take really good care of ourselves.
In school and at work, you will find your self facing,
what I would call Profit Optimization.
Mediocre teachers will want a perfect mediocre score,
that is slightly above their last year statistics so that they may show improvement.
The average employer will want you to do more for less,
or to get more out of you, without investing more into you.
And that means,
pushing you past your healthy balance.
Encouraging use of medications that help with temporary memory at school,
and whatever pushes you into overwork and over performing at work.
If you don&apos;t do that,
you will be replaced by someone who is willing to live sick for the minimum you got paid, or less.
Allow me to digress, and say that to deal with both of these issues in a healthy fashion,
you can self-educate and and aim to build a serious of start-ups.
Now, when building your companies, you will be tasked with not pushing yourself,
while it is easier to overwork in short term, it is not worth it in long term.
You need heart, and soul, and long visions and thoughts to craft your own future,
and being stressed, depressed, and overworked will only take those powers away from you.
Living healthy should be the easiest thing for you, cramming, overworking, stressing, depressing,
and squeezing every last bit of energy out of yourself, aught to be the more difficult path.
Just listen to what I am saying;
when you are healthy and in balance with your self, or with nature, whatever you conceive to be:
You are at your most intelligent, and most creative, and strongest self,
you are also most beautiful, and I am sure at your funniest, in that worst of ways where no one is sure if are joking or dead serious.
One of the ways to connect with your elder self,
is to make them better, is to grant them outrageous gifts from your youth.
Even if just to remind them,
who the boss really is, or to make them smile in wonder.
Great beings often appear slightly odd and confusingly funny, just because of that,
they are sending a message into their own future, to guarantee the health of their elder selves.
Culture switching helps a person become unstuck,
it exposes them to new experiences, and removes old discomforts, and often making them more courageous.
It is important to read books, and that means to live in a state that is conducive to inheriting lifetimes of knowledge,
and that state just can&apos;t be found at places that aim to push you out of balance for their own profit.
It sounds terrible, but this is just a call to rising, to self balancing, to becoming an independent thinker,
to leaving all influences whether perceptible of obscured, behind you, in a blur of a series of challenges.
With each new step,
you will learn new things.
With each new culture,
you will become more illuminated.
And with each Great Endeavor,
you will become, greater.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Rise, to get an eagle eye view,
because the world belongs to you.
Too many problems come from fantasies,
there are too many of them to mention.
So many of them are so miserable,
that no poem can hold them.
We can only really rise,
high and above anything and everything.
We can only really make real decisions,
once we have a good view of the world.
Until we are certain that we aren&apos;t under some influence,
we can&apos;t be certain that our decisions are entirely our own.
Great battles come to all of us,
be it stress, cancer, cult, poverty, or country.
We need to be certain that we are fighting the right thing,
it is crazy for a poor person to steal a car to get out of poverty.
It is a whole new level of evil to keep a person so poor,
that they fight the wrong thing, and then send them to prison and slavery.
Nothing, other than reaching out for other lifetimes,
can help us rise tho this height.
And the way we transfer knowledge between lifetimes,
is books, memoirs, biographies, stories of adventure, and triumph, and failure.
All the bad ideas have already been lived, and described, and compressed to wisdom,
don&apos;t let the world stress you out, grab an audio book and figure it all out.
When you are ready,
perhaps come your golden age.
Allow your autobiographical impulse,
to take possession of you, and write down what you have learned.
Share with the little ones,
so that they need not start where you started, but at the height you rose to.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Break out of broken education, religions, governments, and status quo,
do not fear those who secretly fear you, you are a Citizen of the World first.
And be careful, don&apos;t let liars make a fool out of you,
poverty is everywhere, and it fractures those who can&apos;t handle it.
Poverty, frequently causes a poverty of mind,
then all the creativity that makes a person amazing, turns dark.
You have to look around, understand the nature of things,
that&apos;s exactly what books can give you, and school can never teach you.
Self awareness is about gaining some grasp on the layers of influence you are under,
this is so incredibly error prone that people rarely get it right at first.
In their haste for truth they invent things that are not real,
our inability to see what is holding us down is a nightmare.
But not breaking out, is worse than a nightmare, it is a life sentence,
victims of cults, bad parenting, strange or frightening beliefs, eventually unravel.
The road to self awareness, is a road to understanding what is real and
what has been pulled over our eyes to have us serve some purpose.
Sometimes servitude has been so optimized that no one being can spot it,
it takes thousands of people and their donations to catch on the fraud.
Therefore, all people must do their travel upwards, out and over, any and all influence,
and books are critical to helping us up, and towards knowledge and wisdom.
Freedom is the first and foremost human right, freedom to go anywhere,
freedom to think anything, freedom to dream and share, freedom of speech and inspiration.
Now, look at school, look how easily you accepted your grades,
how easily you got misled into memorization and got cheated out of learning.
You never noticed school was bad,
even though it was unfair and often made no sense.
All this evidence, right in front of your eyes,
but you kept believing.
My Friends,
you are the New Generations, you are the change you hope to see.
You must practice self awareness,
and learn to see through, what you have accepted for granted, and the cultures you were born into.
Our task is to Unite Humanity so that there is no more War, no more Poverty, no more Lies,
so that all Darkness is brought into light of Wisdom, and for all to see.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Education in the context of an individual is the path to wisdom and greatness,
in the context of the whole world, however, education is a path to World Peace.
Education is a very unusual thing,
it enhances everything it can touch.
To borrow from movies,
education is our loading program.
To borrow from computers,
education is our operating system.
Without education, we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,
we end up living in villages and inventing gods to help with harvest and afterlife.
Organized and mandatory education is a recent invention,
it works up to middle school where teachers begin hiding inexperience behind abstractions.
When teaching a class of multiple students there is only time for lowest common denominators,
everything gets hurried along and those who can&apos;t understand something begin memorizing.
Within a few years everyone is temporarily memorizing everything to be sure they graduate,
those who try to learn, are graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.
Nobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,
and teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.
That is not education,
that is memorization, acting.
Our loading program does not load,
our operating system does not initialize.
System crashes,
and fathers eagerly send their boys to kill boys of other fathers.
Politics becomes infested with pretenders, actors, con-men, and simple liars,
voters simply don&apos;t think about electing people who show wisdom, who share books.
Lack of modern knowledge and the stress it begets will slow people down,
it will be difficult to become wise, it may not be possible to become great.
Failure to propagate modern knowledge, seems to take the shape of,
an uneducated majority, and a tiny educated minority without any voting power.
Once the failure of education takes hold,
nothing can be done to fix the anomalies that occur afterwards.
The only way to help things along is to avoid the emergence of anomalies in the first place,
and that means having a functional educational system.
If it is not possible for a nation to teach its children,
if the dream of organized, mandatory and standardized education is not realistic.
Personalized computer based, self education must be put in its place,
the transition can be made easy by transitioning from grades to money, credits, or bonds.
The initial computer based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,
a little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.
I write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,
but what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.
We are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other&apos;s beliefs based on color of skin,
they come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.
We have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,
of someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.
We have two nations that feature concentration camps,
and the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.
All of this is happening because of failure of schooling,
inability of politicians to build.
Now, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,
which deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.
We can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation&apos;s future,
and that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.
Let us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,
countries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.
Students in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,
and the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.
After all what is more prestigious than the child&apos;s real knowledge,
a child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.
Making some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,
and it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.
Graduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can&apos;t be erased with bankruptcy,
but with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.
The cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,
this is what it means to have a country.
What we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,
and research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.
We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,
where it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.
We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,
that sometimes make children die of starvation.
Humanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,
it has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.
For those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,
take a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.
Initially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,
would set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.
Call it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,
in process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.
Out of Love and Wisdom,
out of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.
And my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,
what would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">The best way to win against a liar, is to never meet one,
the simplest way to &quot;win&quot; is not to play their game.
This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,
liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.
One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,
they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn&apos;t cause much headache.
But it, looking like an expensive medicine, and costing like one,
when people felt it in their system, they automatically assumed it was working.
This is still going on, and when I was a teenager I actually bought a skin cleanser,
at a pharmacy, in the US, that in no uncertain terms, stated that this was homeopathic medicine,
Home and medicine, sounded good to me,
and it seemed to have been a gentle soap, but it was just the cheapest thing that they could possibly put in a tube.
I checked the top three pharmacies in the US in 2020, and heart-breakingly,
they all continue selling homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
Knowledge and Wisdom, and the path it entails,
is the most wonderful and safest way to avoid all this nonsense.
Because once you become more knowledgeable than the liar,
you will be able to hear them bending words, and twisting stories, the way your Mum was able to pick up on subtle cues when you were lying as a baby.
Now, past some point in an education, many, or perhaps most people, front healthy skepticism first,
not because they assume everyone is a liar, but because they wonder if someone might not have tricked themselves into a falsehood like I did with my homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
More than that, when I was a teenager, and someone asked me if Mokele-mbembe existed,
I would whole heatedly, and with all the love in my heart, say:
&quot;I hope so, after all, it is not a question of their existence, is it now? They used to exist millions of years ago.
It is a question of whether or not there is one or two, left in Rhodesia.&quot; - with a heavy and hairy accent, whilst bouncing my unibrow up an down.
Anybody asking me about cryptozoology was better off,
fronting mountains of skepticism first - the brontosaurus was my favorite dinosaur!
And get this, Brontosaurus is no longer the same thunder lizard we are all familiar with,
it was a misclassification, the dinosaur that you think of as Brontosaurus is actually called Apatosaurus now.
In context of liars, which are pretty damn scary, and only get more frightening as they come together in groups,
...searching for forgiveness, reinforcement and easy pickings to whatever their disorder is; we need to take to knowledge and wisdom as soon as possible.
Middle school, is a pretty good time to start learning for real,
and start climbing over everyone&apos;s heads, to get ahead of things.
Books narrated by their authors,
are an especially precious gift of knowledge.
Bill Bryson has some nice and funny books that help people grow,
A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, and In a Sunburned Country, are beautiful.
But it is best that you start with what moves you,
look at various best seller lists, and keep an eye on non-fiction of you can.
And climb, keep searching for that next book that will agree with you,
and explore everything, explore the world, the trails, the libraries, all the places of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.
It does not take many books to get ahead of liars,
it only takes a few more to get ahead of those that don&apos;t know they are causing harm.
And here the handful of your beloved Memoirs, Biographies, and adventure books,
will transform, to your Sword and Shield, and you will fell many a monster and dragon, onward to a cheerful future.
Start learning on your own, not just to avoid liars and crappy people,
but to become you, the person that you are predisposed to be.
As you grow, there will be some mild regrets, but it is not going to be anything huge,
and whatever you do end up missing by taking your own less traveled road...
Use is as a compass, just because you missed something, it doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t find it again,
feeling like you missed something is a beautiful call to new adventure.
There is nothing to be scared of, by choosing the path of Knowledge, Wisdom, and maybe Greatness,
those are the very components by which humanity grows.
Our superpowers that grant us the abilities to prevent suffering.
making our pains count for more by fixing the problems that hurt us, and preventing others from falling into the same trap.

                      <span class="text-muted">The Universe works in very honest ways,
when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.
When we face impossible problems,
someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.
When governments become too complex,
the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.
When liars start winning all the battles,
your wisdom will become even more precious.
A senator&apos;s boy brought into positions of authority,
by means of favors, shortcuts, and being told what to say, can&apos;t become wise.
Wisdom grows from within our authenticity, dignity, and love,
from clarity of vision, and being moved by generations of giants.
Authenticity helps us up,
wisdom on top of wisdom, plateau by plateau onward to greatness.
Inauthenticity, can only build temporary things,
that soon collapse under their own weight for lack of foundation.
Just because you feel hopelessness,
when you dream about making the world a better place...
It does not mean you should stop loving, thinking, writing,
when the future comes asking: what is next?
Your books are to be complete, beloved, and held in high esteem,
your works must move the world.
All that is true, and worthy of human kind,
requires generations of work, same inspiration, same vision.
May your works serve as the first stepping stone,
a source of rules that will keep Humanity Safe and Sound.
May your works inspire countless generations,
across all the world&apos;s nations.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We have a tendency to take things for granted,
and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.
It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.
The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.
Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.
The world has also become more interconnected,
those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.
Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,
all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.
There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,
the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.
All the fantasies and walls will fade, today&apos;s problem with borders and cults,
is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,
to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.
We are infinite in our minds,
just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.
Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,
something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.
It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,
and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.
This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,
this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.
And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,
the sciences call to everyone.
Personalized education doesn&apos;t really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,
as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.
Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,
and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.
We don&apos;t learn the way schools teach,
we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.
By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,
problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.
A more knowledgeable world,
is a more capable world.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Each generation, including yours, Dear Reader,
is charged with figuring out, what is wrong.
Previous generations discovered many wrongs,
Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.
Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,
we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.
The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,
is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.
Liars everywhere, in the blindness caused by lack of education,
are easily out-competing generations of beings who dedicated their lives to the betterment of Human Kind.
Children are forced to memorize and pretend to learn to get good grades,
and hope to go to colleges and universities that hardly live up to their promises.
Their job search, and school loans,
the way they are treated from interview to retirement does not do them justice.
The younger generations are the Sacred Hope and Future of Human Hind,
but they are now exploited by old fat lice who cannot stop feeding even if their life depends on it.
The teachers in their haste to bring a little paycheck home have lost the respect for students,
professors now sell home-made textbooks as ineffective as their lectures, and universities.
The children can see all this,
they understand the minds of these failures.
They merely need to ask:
&quot;How would I have to think, and how low would I have to sink, to do as they do.&quot;
Humanity requires a real educational system to effectively pass knowledge between generations,
when we finally create it, we will see blind stupidity and all the evils it fuels, fade.
My friends, this is not a difficult project,
we come together to record video lectures, write and narrate books.
We pay,
for outstanding contributions and translations of these lectures.
That payment,
is the grade.
We create a massively multiplying and overlapping global educational system,
that has no structure, and countless redundant paths towards knowledge, excellence and wisdom.
Those paths,
are the diploma.
Companies that show compassion, worth and balance,
inspect these paths in search of talent.
Even so, students are encouraged to build multi-founder start-ups,
throughout the world and their lives.
This world school, is not an neat addition to this world,
this school: Becomes Our World.
It becomes our point of convergence on World Peace,
and the Library of Ideas worth keeping.
The fundamentally broken naysayers will come,
as the erosion of the good ideas and propagation of war, poverty, and all other bad ideas is their food.
But those who stand against Prosperity, Unity, Knowledge, Wisdom and World Peace,
are just an animated rotting corpse that needs to be left behind in the poverty and desperation they once exploited to their advantage.
For the sake of the future generations,
let us rise against evil and mediocrity.
May we abandon all that moves against the grain of reality,
and all that is fake, ineffective, and lacking positive, real, and permanent results.
Let us cradle the future generations in Knowledge, in Wisdom, and in Greatness,
and honor them and their challenges, with World Peace.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We can&apos;t have a standardized education,
because that would require a standardized life.
A life in which we are only passionate about
what we are told to be passionate about.
A life, where memorization,
does suffice.
My friends, the standardization of your existence,
is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.
A standardized existence is one
where your mind is taken from you.
Just like you recoil at the thought of a standardized breakfast,
the words standardized education should make you feel sick!
Even if you could learn by being taught like a little bird is fed,
how could you allow someone to pick the knowledge for your mind?
Allowing someone to insert standardized lessons into your mind is disgusting,
you are a unique and sacred being, born a genius and meant to be driven to wisdom and greatness.
You are meant to be the hope and dreams of all the past generations,
school, job, career, retirement and some promise of world travel is not how real life works.
The people in charge of creating early schools might not have had the opportunity
to create schools that are capable of inspiring the students to great heights.
Since, we have only updated that imperfect first attempt at mass education,
we lost the original dream of helping the world become Knowledgeable and Wise.
Today, teachers create cookie cutter lessons and matching tests,
that they expect you to cram for, in what has now become a Mockery of Real Education.
Standardization is evil and dangerous, it shows a total misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
it is a dangerous waste of time, that often destroys joy, uniqueness, talent, and other colorful predispositions.
Teachers can only help students to books,
they need to focus on creating and recording quality video lectures.
The greatest education that can be given to student is one afforded by student exchange programs,
beyond that it must be a path they pick; by choosing the materials that interest them.
A standardized education does not have enough depth to help the student grow,
it can only slow them down and restrict them.
An ordinary teacher is one, even a classroom and school is one,
and cannot reach a unique student in a way that they are ready for.
But copies of video lectures, audio books, interactive games, and books,
can! reach every student, and just at the right place in their development.
The world is changing at an increasingly faster pace,
the brittle ideas behind original standardized education never quite lived up to their promise.
Let us work towards replacing standardized education
with life-long personalized education.
Education that drives a student to Authenticity, Knowledge, Independence, Entrepreneurship, and Wisdom,
and not the curse of an uninspired existence born of broken promises, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and depression.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We all start with a Great Dignity, and Great Nobility,
we are full of genius and imagination, and impossible dreams.
We have to take good care for that,
and use our Dignity and Nobility to transcend all limits, and beyond.
There is a very tiny probability,
that we maybe all the intelligence and impossible dreams that the universe has ever seen.
Either way, we are royals, we are special and beyond impossible,
our ability to learn, to out-learn, to out-think, to abstract, is infinite.
We created these little schools that double as babysitters, and distractions,
but we need to make them second to our real education.
And our real education comes from about a thousand books we pick on our own,
and listen and read to throughout our entire life, noting must interfere with that.
You just need to take one step to get the taste for wisdom,
listen to top ten adventure and travel and or hiking or jogging audio books.
The way your spirit grows from taking part in other peoples adventure,
will show you, by subtle analogy, what the countless other steps will help you become.
A wise and great being, adventurer, some kind of an amazing genius,
and a beacon of hope, and light of inspiration, and love.
The lessons you choose with your own heart and mind,
are far more important than the lessons others are trying to make you cram for.
Books will grant you wisdom that will help you avoid regrets,
they will enhance your decision making and long term visions.
Books belong to you,
their wisdom is your intellectual inheritance.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Without reading powerful books written by wise beings,
all we can really do is come up with half-baked conspiracy theories.
Does High School work?
or does it destroy creativity, uniqueness, and self esteem.
Does college work?
Or is everyone participating in a mutually beneficial dog an pony show?
Are we supposed to just get a job? or or build a career?
And what about Start-ups and Entrepreneurship and Invention?
These questions matter, if you are in highs school,
and high school isn&apos;t working, or working out...
Then what actually is going on,
is that you are falling behind on knowledge and wisdom.
It is not that high school becomes easy or irrelevant when it is ineffective,
but that all this knowledge that would give you more insight into the world, is stolen from you.
Without that empowering knowledge;
a good grasp on the human condition, a good intuition for liars, manipulators and cheaters.
Without being well grounded in reality, we&apos;ll be forced into desperation,
into confusion, and all to easily swayed from the paths that we want to walk on.
With a real education, you can operate an online business,
or write software, or become an art fanatic and illustrator without any upfront investment.
You gain so much support from what you can do,
that poverty ceases to be frightening, and you are allowed to develop further.
In school we face this notion of grades and GPA that somehow belittles us,
and then we are led through a standardized education under the banner of balance.
A musician has little interest in biology beyond what a pleasant to read book provides,
in the world of grades it can only distract and hurt, and interrupt their self education.
And yet it appears, that grades exist primarily for getting more funding,
and they are fake, vague, and likely artificially manipulated to show progress.
Participating in nonsense,
can only beget more nonsense.
It is exhausting to try to figure all this out.
But think of a religious college, that puts science second to their particular religion,
think of a diploma mill, and all the colleges that ended up losing accreditation for questionable practices.
Think about all the happy students, all the hard working teachers,
all the nice ladies that made little jokes and loved the students they worked with.
And consider this,
The most complex of lies exist not just simply for gains,
but also because it is highly impossible or cost prohibitive to prove wrong doing, and down right impossible to prove ill intent.
No university professor ever receives an email about now being able to pawn his loose-leaf &quot;books&quot; on the students,
no dean ever asks the professors to let the students cram so that the college can keep their averages high and their accreditation.
These things are implied, assumed, and above all,
part of the very foundation of a for-profit-non-profit that has lobbied not to forgive student loans due to bankruptcy.
There is only one way to answer these questions,
and that is to listen to and perhaps read five to fifteen books on each of these subjects.
We must not allow ourselves to be misled into a life of un-education, and desperation,
a school that can&apos;t provide results better, than you listening to a few dozen audio-books on some fantastic adventure, is worthless.
The first few years after school should be about us trying to build our own businesses,
to see is there is perhaps something better than being overworked for the rest of our lives.
Entrepreneurship is not something that we can memorize,
ideas behind our undertakings have to come from our hearts and souls.
We need a real education for it,
if school is not helping us to our independence, then we must switch to self education.
Years go by pretty quickly when we aren&apos;t progressing forward,
and life has a way of getting ahead of us and challenging us with complexity.
I can&apos;t tell you is schools work or not,
though I am certain that education is life long.
And I can&apos;t pick your books for you,
because only you know the questions that call to you.
But I know that books and especially narrated books and video lectures, that you arrange in a sequence that agrees with you,
and watch at the pace that works best for you, are a powerful way to gain knowledge and to step ever closer to wisdom, and without any distractions.
We owe it to ourselves to find books that help us away from mediocrity,
and help us inherit lifetimes of functional wisdom towards authenticity and independence.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">All that has ever gone wrong,
has gone wrong due to rejecting realities, and accepting, fantasies.
To deny truth, is to create a terrible fantasy,
and no human being should ever be committed to one - as life is far too precious.
Yes, fantasies in a sickly way are more comfortable,
than the authentic life that unfolds by rules independent from our wishes.
But rejecting pleasant fantasies is no different
than the rejection of drugs.
It is simply not who we are,
and not where healthy people wish to be, or can possibly grow.
It is not that the world is too difficult to grasp,
but that, too many people are suffering from lack of knowledge.
Knowledge is found in books, best experience in their audio form,
and on a pleasant and relaxing adventure.
Books whose authors are admired for their hard work, clarity of long therm vision,
intelligence, wisdom, and often a wonderful sense of humor.
Alas, far too many people take to relive their fears by,
by constructing a view of the world they can understand and control.
All fantasies will eventually call for reinforcement,
and as history shows, at any, and all cost.
Be it something as tiny as the number of likes on a social network,
as odd as the status that pointlessly-expensive-cars bring.
Or something as heartbreaking as political systems,
where fathers will easily send their children to kill each other in battle fields.
A fantasy will call for reinforcement,
to keep it going to make it last, and no price will ever be too big.
Reality, is much harsher and not as comfortable or easy to grasp,
will call for constant effort, hard earned foresight, real and lasting results to our endeavors, and authentic dignity.
In reality; color of skin, numbered of colored pieces of paper, or the colors of a flag,
do not define who is superior, and who is inferior, who is better and who is worse.
In fantasy, poverty and war, are facts of life,
in reality, Love, Health, and World Peace, are, the most beautiful rewards for the most difficult of achievements.
In fantasy we crated tens of thousands of gods and as many battles in their worship,
in reality we invent Flight, try to get to the Moon for no clear reason, and even fantasize about Interstellar Travel to cross the galaxy.
In reality there is no evil, just a steady and colorful progress forward, we build Nuclear Plants and not Nuclear Missiles,
in fantasy evil oozes from the cracks that mad men must keep patching to prevent their small minds from falling to a thousand pieces.
Fantasies spread with culture,
they quite imperceptibly trick us into thinking of ourselves as other than we really are.
For example, if you don&apos;t believe you can be a genius,
you will not be able to become one, you&apos;ll never aim for it.
The longer you delay, the more obstacles will arise in your path
if you don&apos;t believe you can cross that challenge, you won&apos;t even try.
If you grant others control over your time, or life,
you will only limit yourself and how far you can travel.
Your mind is powerful enough to host cities of thoughts and dreams of, any size,
the only limit to your intelligence is the ability to mistakenly stop your self by accepting some falsehood.
Love, genius, empathy, foresight and insight, and spirituality exist within us all,
but without knowledge and eventual wisdom they too are limited and fall short.
Yes, at first, the real world is unknown to us,
but it is not meant to frighten us into creating fantasies that we think we can grasp.
It simply requires that we listen to a hundred books,
take a moment to explore the world around us with our new found experience...
And then very slowly and very gently as our long lives unfold,
listen to, and read, just about nine hundred more as not to ever fall short, and always have a beautiful story to tell.
We are sure to become wise, with all the building blocks we gain from books,
and then, if should we wish, we can turn right around and create some new books for others to read, and grow up with.
Do not be scared my friends,
as scary as poverty is, its power flows precisely from lack of education, wisdom and above all foresight.
The more knowledgeable and wiser the world,
the more overwhelming the force to crush poverty.
Growing up to become knowledgeable and wise as opposed to merely age in some easy fantasy,
is critical for our mental health and well being.
A thousand books you can listen to while traveling worlds most beautiful hiking trails,
is hardly a challenge, it shouldn&apos;t even be seen as a inconvenience.
Inheriting real and functional knowledge, that has a powerful and lasting impact on our growing up,
that enriches and enhances our decision making bringing us clear visions and impossible dreams is a great reward.
Becoming broke, or homeless, never being able to get a job, and being seen as a waste of life,
is not something that can happen to a wise a beautiful person that rejects fantasies in search of truths.
And it is important to remember,
that we can&apos;t graduate a by cramming and temporary memorizing disconnected facts.
A fake education,
is a meaningless education.
Companies known for hiring such inauthentic individuals are full of life draining liars and pretenders and probably in high positions,
whatever they build cannot be built with vision and wisdom, it can only self destruct.
Once you become self educated,
you are granted the opportunity to build your own companies with foresight and invention.
My dear reader, I would bet building an open and grade-free school that actually educates its students will be high up on your to-do list.
Building companies only becomes stressful when you build them for their own sake due to lack of vision,
when you enter on the path towards wisdom, you won&apos;t merely aim to impress investors, you will move generations.
It is OK to blindly set off towards wisdom,
it is one of the few leaps of faith that are worth the while.
Whatever your aims, may you inspire countless dreamers to greatness,
and may you reject all fantasy, holding authenticity and wisdom as the highest of values.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Knowledge has an enormous impact on decision making,
if you don&apos;t know enough you maybe taken advantage of.
You gain knowledge by means of authentic education,
an education that has maximum impact on your existence.
Memorization or cramming is not an authentic education,
it is not any kind of education.
You don&apos;t want to rely on a doctor that memorized everything in school,
professionals must look things up to keep up with changes.
Memorization is only good for two things,
passing tests, and getting you ready for a factory job on an assembly line.
And on the other end, tests are for teachers to keep their jobs,
and principals to keep getting funding.
You have to make sure that you are not getting sold for a money,
that you are not being used to sustain an outdated industry.
And above all, do not let them trick you into thinking yo are not smart,
we are all extremely smart, we are all, without exception extremely good at learning for real.
The problem is with schools, they are trying to use a single teacher,
to teach anywhere between 30 and 300 students.
There is no way that a teacher can handle that,
so they will make up tests so that majority passes and damn the rest.
Memorization is just a temporary circus trick,
make sure you are learning meaningful things that have lasting impact.
Real education will multiply you,
fake education will make a fool out of you.
Decision-making is one of the most important things in life,
we need Real Education, Real Knowledge to help us make correct decisions in life.
Many of the decisions we make early on,
have long term impact that continues for decades in not for life.
It also matters that we grow up in an authentic culture,
if we are surrounded by lairs that too will contribute to push us off the path we want to be on.
You must ask if perhaps the school industry is using outdated teaching methods
that barely worked during industrial revolution, to keep getting government money.
Every student in every country,
from middle school to university must to check if they are really learning for real.
Real education is one that enriches a person with Knowledge gained in previous generations,
real education provides many lifetimes of knowledge in a beautifully arranged bouquet.
In turn, that Knowledge grows in you as its components become your own building blocks,
and help you to become Strong, Happy, Wise, Beautiful,
and eventually help you become a Great Being, one who makes lasting contributions to Human Kind.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Real Education, makes you, more you,
it greatly enhances your all predispositions.
No one has the right to hold you in contempt for your talents,
no one has the right to tell you who you should become.
All pursuits of excellence lead to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,
the longer it takes the more precious the result.
Ignore the so called teachers that will try to control you, or sway you off your path,
their only wish is to make their own lives easier even if it means sacrificing who you are.
Real education is somehow completely misunderstood,
and people do end up getting lost in life.
For example, some may enjoy a single subject,
and fall behind on all the rest.
Then, to fix their grades,
they are made to focus on fixing subjects that they are bad at.
In the process they interrupt themselves,
they are made to interfere with their own, more-real education.
And, here the beneficiary is the teacher and the dean,
and the reward is eventual raises for keeping GPAs stable.
Long after these frauds are gone,
their victims suffer, never having found a comfortable place.
Sometimes, even after the fools are gone people continue feeling guilt for their talents,
they become convinced that doodles are dumb, and poems are stupid.
It is hard to find happiness in doing things that we don&apos;t care about,
it maybe impossible even.
A life void of happiness,
is a life of depression and constant anxiety.
Even the smallest of our predispositions will develop into unique greatness,
a greatness that is hard to see at first, hard to reason about.
Let me make this clear, Real Education is not about getting a job,
it is about becoming a Great Being, who has much more to add.
And some people,
are a little bit ahead of their time.
For example kids that like to fly drones,
may never fully get into it, unless...
they get access to drones equipped with cameras,
that they can steer through a VR helmet, as if they were piloting them.
If they stick with it,
they will enter electronics, mathematics and software development.
If they get bored, or can&apos;t afford the hardware,
then they will lose something of themselves.
Rule of thumb here,
is to take a predisposition all the way, at all cost.
Hobbies or silly interests are gateways into sciences,
and should always be honored and seen as something very special.
One massive problem is the teachers and parents,
who when lacking similar predispositions will tend to destroy talent.
And they do it because they don&apos;t want their kid to stick out,
they don&apos;t need the extras and the questions that come along with them.
They may say that games are for children,
and talents are useless.
They will say such things because they can&apos;t handle life,
as someone took their talent away and now everything is cumbersome and more than they bargain for.
Coupled with organized and standardized schooling
that divide subjects into meaninglessness and noise that can only be memorized.
Sprinkle in some bullies,
that hate kids that stick out.
All that on top of already bad grades,
as the student may not even be aware that everyone is just memorizing.
And much is lost,
and most permanently.
Real Education is a source of joy, strength,
and contributes to love of life.
The effects of real education
are hard to describe.
It is the different between a pop star, and a girl forced to repeat the semester because she used to like music.
It is the difference between,
a quickly forgotten politician and a famous philosopher that continues to inspire generations.
Between a writer that dabbles in forgettable romance novels,
and one that helps us to understand a strange world of tyranny without tyrants one that we must reject.
Real education creates beings that change lives,
their Works come out of Greatness, nobly fueled by Wisdom and Knowledge.
To deny the becoming of a Great Being is to deny Growing Up,
it means to deny joy, happiness, and love of life.
Everyone is acting as if Greatness and Great Wisdom is rare,
all the while they are stopping each other from a Real Education.
It is Real Education that brings people into areas of Knowledge that they are predisposed to further,
granting them Wisdom, and eventually Greatness.
People who conspire against talent,
are Guidance Counselors, Teachers, and Parents, precisely those who are meant to encourage it.
We must honor the talents and predispositions of the younger generations,
by building personalized educational systems that lead them to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
We must remove all barriers that stand in their way,
the future of the world is in their hands.

                    <span class="text-muted">Just because the world is being tardy,
it does not mean you should be too.
In deed, if you fail to slowly make haste,
then the world will become darker for it.
Every Human must shine,
with Enlightenment.
I know it is hard to accept
that schools may not be working.
We all have so little,
and now even more even rugs are pulled from beneath our feet.
There is other stuff too,
from bad parenting to mutually assured destruction.
I am sorry, if you are looking for answers,
the best answers any of them will ever give you is: &quot;How were we supposed to know?&quot;
A solid foundation in reality is a good start in life,
sometimes we don&apos;t figure things out until it is too late.
I know this poem caught you early,
you have a long time to ponder all this.
And that too is a good start,
a proper Gentlelady or Gentleman questions everything, and takes nothing for granted.
I hope you are still in Middle School or High School,
and you get to walk to your desk, with a heavy step.
Slouch, perk up your ears like a Lion,
and take the whole situation apart.
The kids in the back figured it out already,
but that is as far as they got, they need more answers.
They need you!
the leader.
Maybe you can try thinking about debates,
learning from the way Great Beings argue the pretenders or the uneducated.
You are already given reasons,
now you need to find the truth.
It is never too early,
to begin to question everything.
One of the smallest arguments we are given, is the argument for mathematics,
well, it used to be given, it was that we aren&apos;t always going to have a calculator on hand.
Though it is cute to say that we have smart phones with calculators that have advanced mode,
there is a darker side to it.
Mathematics is not enough,
we need Programming, and we need to be Shell Literate as well.
Vapid and Insipid Mathematics poisoned the beauty of Science,
memorization of formulas obscured the simpler beauty beneath.
Memorization is another problem,
look how carefully you are nudged to abandon reason and understanding in favor of memorization.
The guillotine of failing a class because you tried to learn everything,
instead of passing with a straight A+ for merely cramming for the test - DOES chop your head off.
Look how proud your teacher is, that disingenuous show of teeth,
up for another raise, sold you for a paycheck and on some simple memes that you can get from a calendar.
One of the biggest reasons given to you,
is that you need a Diploma to get a Job.
I would like you to consider, that perhaps a real diploma,
is one that a University goes out of their way to give; you for your Great Achievements.
The diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,
while it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...
...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,
the best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.
Your life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,
there is no Life Arithmetic.
The closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:
Each life is more important than the other.
If someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,
you quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.
If the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,
then you are going to need to try harder.
In case you are wondering,
- I care, and you can&apos;t undo that.
The harder, or the less worn path,
is that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.
And you are not going to be the first or only one,
find the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.
So when someone says &quot;Diploma&quot;,
you reply; &quot;Check Your Premise&quot;, to quote an old friend.
When they say calculator,
you say: &quot;Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.&quot;
When they box you in to memorize,
you get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.
While governments are smart enough to encourage learning,
as evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.
I suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,
in that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.
But you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,
a government can&apos;t easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.
The way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,
is to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.
Self education is not that outrageous,
that is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.
And let me underline that interference will destroy self education,
grades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.
Self education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,
and instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.
Finally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but &quot;Free College&quot; is not quite right,
it should be &quot;Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results&quot;
Compare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don&apos;t need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,
we need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.
You should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,
a good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.
The thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,
as that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.
All you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,
and a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.
And then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,
find a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...
You will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16&quot; Bowie knife (don&apos;t do 14&quot;), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...
and a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.
As you read more and more,
and things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.
Bring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,
one with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.
Later on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,
fool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.
Though I highly recommend section hiking at first,
and also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.
You know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,
and that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.
And that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,
you do graduate ever higher.
I think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height
- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.</span>
