learning slowly in many stages.
I begun in 1999,
and I am still learning new things about design.
All the programming languages changed many times,
but knowing the whole history is very useful at times.
I&apos;ve learned a lot from the command line,
to art, colors, design, and how to reach the finish line.
I am surprised how long it all took,
but with all I know I am sure I could write a whole book.
I still have to learn a bunch of stuff,
but it is not going to be very tough.
I mostly have to get all the colors, and glows to dance and blend,
I kind of left all the fun stuff for the very end.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Let the deans nod to the graduates that drink most coffee,
sitting with presidents and dignitaries,
let them smile that each passed their trial.
But you, Dear Mother, you take your child to the Library,
make it their Castle, make it their Home,
make it their Temple of Knowledge.
&quot;My Mother used to bring me here almost every day,
this is my Temple of Knowledge, this is my Forever Home.&quot;
Teach that non-fiction, especially Memoirs,
are the only safe way to grow up.
Keep them on a path to understanding of the simplest things first,
and the most important things second so that they may build an easy on-ramp for themselves.
Remind them, that all young mistakes have already been made countless times,
that all the lessons, answers, and hopes of prevention,
are to be found in sacred stories of Triumph and Disaster.
That there is little in blind following.
And that there is Everything in pursuit of Wisdom,
to join with the Greater Family of the Great Human Beings,
that came before us and are sure to follow.
That school is just a Dream,
of a Simpler Universe,
a melody sweetly played,
but not in tune.
That our mind at its most responsible,
is the Sole Institution that we require,
for Pursuits of Excellence and Higher Learning.
So as long as we love ourselves,
as long as we are compassionate to ourselves,
we can comprehend inside out, many times the knowledge,
of those who are taught, outside in.
Let the Temple of Knowledge,
shine its beacon and sound the bell,
each time the little ones need answers,
and each time they are ready to commit their own wisdom to History.
World Peace requires,
that each child today,
becomes a Great Being,
in the Greater Tomorrow.
World Peace has little to do with the unobtainable ceasefire today,
and has everything to do, with letting children grow up under blue skies,
without drone strikes, deafening echoes of explosions, bullet riddled walls, and detention camps.
May the Greatness of Your Vision, and Unbreakability of your Heart and Mind,
help the Unstoppable Children of today, become the Great Beings the Future Needs.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">We have to remind each other,
that change requires,
that you and I grow.
That we grow in strength,
that we grow in experience.
that we grow in knowledge.
That we grow in Wisdom,
that we grow in Foresight.
That we grow all the way up.
We can&apos;t afford expensive Universities,
we don&apos;t even have the time.
We don&apos;t really want to graduate from Brown,
or Harvard, or Yale.
What we really want, is to spend a semester at each,
and for our hard earned wisdom to count as much as their Curriculum and GPA.
It would be nice to give a graduation speech,
though, it wouldn&apos;t last for very long,
everyone is so busy on that day.
And what a drop in the ocean,
a few years will seem come our Golden Age of Wisdom.
We have to be heard, BEYOND, a mere graduation speech,
and we have to learn FAR BEYOND anything a class can teach us.
We can&apos;t afford to be students, not for a year, not for a day,
because we are born at a gallop, and onward; to become an unstoppable force of Nature,
AND CHANGE, Meaningful Change.
That means, your little High School poetry book,
makes it into the back pocket of Every High School Troublemaker and Dropout.
And they will rely on your Down To Earth Greatness, and Your Unlimited, Unconfined, Hard Earned Wisdom,
to get through their nights, and to cross to the hills,
and to begin their Unlimited Journey to Their Mountain Tops.
There isn&apos;t time for classroom experience,
there is only time for Wisdom, Love and a Meaningful Contributions.
Every new intellectual,
each new dreamer, poet, writer or orator hoping to help the world grow,
needs a far greater audience, and a greater runway for a greater wisdom,
than any University can provide.
The changes cannot come from the Policy Makers, or Impressive Dignitaries, or Inspired Professors,
they can only come form deep within each and every Human Being alive today, and all those that are yet to come,
standing - on their own - in relentless pursuit of Excellence and Wisdom, not Grades, or Prestige.
We don&apos;t need more laws, more prisons, talking heads, and deans,
we need to take to the audio books, video lectures, the internet,
and learn at a speed far greater than any curriculum can offer.
Begin recording your first audio book,
listen to what you know,
and where you need to know more.
Pull yourself up by your own shoelaces,
let Unrestrained Education take over.
Wisdom graded by the lives you touch,
by the disasters you avert,
by the wisdom you share.
Let us set fairy tales aside,
and let us accept responsibility for our own education.
And encouraging all we meet to do the same,
there can not be a greater Brand Name,
than a Wise Humanity.
The world needs our help,
it is a call far beyond what Universities can point us towards to.
The world needs all... the Humans to Graduate.
From the upcoming politicians with their over-inflated campaigns,
and research that relies on low education and short foresight of the voter.
To those of us, who didn&apos;t want to go to MIT, or Harvard,
because we felt it only hold us back, if not downright break our heart.
Universities are little promises meant for a smaller and happier world,
the world of today is far too big to be moved by mere graduates,
even if it was all the universities trying all at once.
Every Human Being requires an Outstanding Education,
one that empowers them to stand up against all the wrong in the world today.
With the light of Intellectual Inheritance worthy of The Noblest Independent Human,
and the light they themselves bring to the world come their Golden Age of Wisdom.
My Dear Reader,
may you learn, and piece together so much wisdom,
as to ignite a light so powerful that each and every child in the word,
from across all political borders and language barriers will visit you and listen,
and grow in wisdom with your lesson and enlightenment.
Let us part part with the idea of an exclusive University and brand name education (whatever that is),
and take to every book worthy of each of us,
and learn more, and faster,
and greater lessons than can be taught outside in.
Because today&apos;s challenges are greater than the solutions that anyone in particular can bring,
the solution is in all of us, reaching and mastering knowledge and wisdom one by one.
The Protection of The Younger Generations from War, Poverty and Greed,
is the first and foremost, and must come as a result of a Wiser Humanity.
World Peace, and Human Rights,
are close second.
The Human Mind and Life is Too Sacred,
for little fairy tales of exclusive education.
Do not wait to be taught,
learn, and learn to no end in sight,
and when you know enough, share; and teach.
And may each Human Being,
grow to know that Wisdom, Growing All The Way Up, Greatness,
is neither optional, nor meant for the lucky few.
Let us accept the responsibility for Outstanding Self Education,
because for the world to grow; it is either all of us, or none.</span>

and where life is very, very, very, very, long.
As it winds along the well worn paths like a little song,
and where there is always a right, that can fix a wrong.
And we are hardly ever alone, so as long as we stand strong,
and you can achieve anything so as long as your effort is lifelong.
Many others traveled all these sandy roads,
many handled much more weight and greater workloads.
But it really all revolves about how much you learn, love, and know,
that&apos;s what helps you get unstuck from that rainy office window.
We don&apos;t have to ride every crazy rodeo,
live beneath an angry grumbling volcano.
Run as if chased by herds of stampeding buffalo,
and like every corner hides a foe.
Beautifully... it is best to live life slow,
in tune with crickets, starry nights, frogs and rain, sunshine, and snow.
Live so slow as to have time to learn, think, and write,
to share with others all that you found to be lovely and bright.
And not knowing what to write about, is the best,
because that means Nordhouse is calling you, to a little quest.
And when you return, you will have to find a warm and cozy nook,
grab a mug of chocolate and let your poems flow into your litte book.
Yup, you may need to pack a back pack, and give it a go,
remember, life is longest, when you live it slow.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">When you gather a comfortable amount of observation,
there is a moment when you go from observer to creator.
It is similar to how you arrive in a new city,
at first you are unsure, but eventually it becomes your home town.
In politics, politicians so through something similar,
but it is a mistake, they become comfortable around manipulators,
and get comfortable with manipulating, propagating the blight.
In the world of books, the authors that resonate with you,
become your friends, Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Dan Brown,
they become family and you get to know them in your own way.
In world adventures, it is called going native, or emanating mana,
one moment you are an outsider, and the next you are riding a bull to work,
where you spend your days working hard on digging new wells,
hurrying to finish before your visa expires and you have get back to the loud and filthy city.
When knowledge becomes internalized, it becomes wisdom,
you become able to synthesize more knowledge out of what you already know,
some call it Enlightenment.
It all cases, it is natural, human, simple and easy to get to,
it is not rare, it is not a power granted only to special people,
it is a power that makes people more special.
If you read enough audio books that move you in the same direction,
you&apos;ll go from listening about something to becoming a participant in thinking about it.
It is a feeling so powerful at first,
that some become convinced they are geniuses,
and have deeper knowledge
&quot;Nope! that&apos;s just your first tipping point dude,
keep going though, because you are just about as amazing as you think you are, don&apos;t stop learning&quot;.
The more tipping points, and plateaus,
upon which we rests as we move towards the sunny parts of our mountain range.
The more capable we become, the more we can synthesize,
and the more of the things we synthesize slowly do become unique and amazing.
Finally, the more we know,
the easier it is to understand other people&apos;s works,
we begin sharing more and more with other creators.
That&apos;s Real Education,
we become specialists in our own unique corners of the world,
Eventually we too get stung by the urge to share what we know,
both the unique little discoveries or contributions we made,
and in memoirs that describe all the twisty little passages that got us there.</span>

Hypatia, Socrates, Giordano Bruno; that is always the Noblest start,
you start in the beginning.
Then,
Books, Audio Books, School Library, Public Library, Every Library.
You learn and rise, to improve on their works.
then Ayn Rand, Avital Ronell, Martha Nussbaum, everyone, Every Great Mind.
But also your mind,
knowing that it is your Sacred Right to protect its integrity,
completeness,
beauty.
Those who are attacking you, belittling you, threatening you, expecting you to serve,
those who make you feel fear, dread, pain,
will destroy you - if you let them.
Resist, peacefully, like the greatest of warriors,
see their rage and anger as a flaw in them,
and your inner-peace as a superpower in you.
Know, with all certainty,
that you are The Hope,
and The Dream of the Greatest Minds, awakened thus far.
It was you that Hypatia, Socrates, Giordano Bruno sent the last of their Hopes and Everlasting Love to.
The Little, You.
The Thinker, The Dreamer, The Wanderer, The Watcher and Observer.
They cared not for Prime Ministers, and Presidents, or Royalty.
Only For The Other Saints.
Only for the Little Ones.
You.
You are not to be a victim of indoctrination into cultures of Fat White Lice.

the one Constructed by Hope and Dream,
of the Greatest of Warriors who have made great strides through he greatest of trials.
We begin by learning to Prevent Problems,
prevent them before they begin and grow unfixable.
We begin in a world that sees it self across time,
and recognizes that a prolonged failure in leadership will become a cause for Dark Ages.
Dark ages, where multiple generations will have to wait for the politicians to step down of old age,
so that we may take their place and work for All Humanity,
including those who are yet to come.
No one generation is to force another into inheritance of problems like Mass Incarceration,
Fake Schools and Education, few Worthy Professors in deed.
We are not passing on burdens onto You,
we inherited them too,
they just can&apos;t be fixed today.
We are teaching You to rise and learn to prevent things - rather than attempt to fix them directly,
we are asking You to teach your Little Ones to carry on this Great Tradition of Infinite Foresight.
The aim is World Peace,
and Multicultural Convergence on Wisdom.
All Human Beings,
rising to the challenge of becoming; Great Beings,
by inheriting wisdom from Audio Books, Internet Lectures and Videos, Books and Libraries, Museums, and Galleries,
Great Minds form all across History.
The world you see around you now,
with pointless Wars and Murders,
Prisons, Secret Prisons, Concentration Camps,
Torture and Enhanced Interrogation,
Helpless or Lying Politicians,
the plague of &quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;,
Famine, Poverty, Broken Welfare, Heartbreaking Minimum wage,
Ten Million Of Us Behind Bars.
Is what a world becomes when people... Forget.
When they forget,
that we can&apos;t grow without Knowledge and Wisdom,
and that our proper upright posture is that of a Great Being.
We just need to remember,
and we will rise,
and continue on this time.
One Family,
Across All Time,
All Generations,
One Wisdom.

                      <span class="text-muted">Oh, much can be said,
of what one thinks today,
and another tomorrow morning.
But, the world belongs,
to all the future generations,
we are just temporary residents.
We are not to treat Earth,
as if it only belonged to us.
We are to stop lying to children,
that memorization is education.
We are to stop keeping in them in rows,
dividing time into squares,
and subjects into meaninglessness,
in a one-for-all curriculum of poverty of mind.
Respect, is a reward, so don&apos;t demand it,
it is not a demand anybody can make.
And we are to stop thinking in short term,
rather than keeping ten million people in cages,
we need to practice Crime Prevention and put an End to Poverty first.
Rather than economic fairy-tales,
mutually assured destruction, and blind wars,
we need to connect together across borders and in wisdom.
There is very little prestige to be gained,
from hard work and beautiful career, tailored suits,
and expensive cafes if we are not paying attention to all the problems children face.
That&apos;s just reality, the respect of the younger generations cannot be granted for free,
children can&apos;t believe nonsense no matter how convincing the teachers,
and the world won&apos;t grow without Wisdom.
The world will wait,
for several consecutive generations of Wise Beings,
to converge on good ideas, in Peace and Earned Respect.
It will wait.
It need not be hard work, you know,
reading books or listening to audio books comes so easy,
and there is so much we learn - we inherit lifetimes of knowledge.
Though it is Beautiful, and Healing, and Wonderful,
Wisdom is not just for us, it is for all the future.
Many of the problems that overwhelm us,
really can&apos;t be repaired, the career politicians are lying.
The big problems,
can only be prevented with Foresight, and Love, and Wisdom,
and require hard work by multiple generations
And that can only begin with Real Education,
and Real Love of Wisdom.
Please rise to the challenge,
and become a great being.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">The Human Mind is beautiful,
but as we grow, it requires upgrades, education, insights.
Philosophy, Love of Wisdom,
the uncontradictory arrangement of thoughts which that represents,
must constantly aim to correct, expand and refine it self.
Even while in pursuit of knowledge and finest thoughts,
we will unfortunately inherit some mistaken observations.
Philosophers often do their best work right on the edge of their very limits,
they can&apos;t haul all their tools out there, they do their best, when they do their most.
We have to check their work, and should they mistaken,
we have to come to their aid, and make repairs to their works.
This is why me must constantly monitor what we are learning,
even if the ideas come from people we are admire.
In a word,
we too have to become Philosophers.
Philosophers and Great Beings aim to bring light to the world,
light of Knowing and Knowledge, light for The Human Condition.
They welcome repairs to their works,
they hope, you will come to think with them.
And they hope that You too,
will become a Philosopher.
Wisdoms alter our decision making, sometimes reverse our opinions,
we must learn, we must inherit all of the greatest wisdoms.
Without that education and inheritance,
we can&apos;t be sure if the choices we are meaning are correct.
In some cases - allegory of the cave, altered education, or just cheap propaganda,
we can&apos;t even be sure if the opinions we hold dear are our own,
or if they are simply effects of the facts that we have been allowed to learn and grow with.
Pursuit of Wisdom, in all its color, not only makes us wise,
but it helps us become leaders, and pushes us away from the life of following.
While becoming a Philosopher or a Great Being may seem optional today,
ask your Elder Self,
if being able to inspire the younger generation to Genius is something that you may wish for.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">If the world had an enemy,
its greatest weapon would be the control of the level of knowledge,
and control of what is allowed to be known.
Even without an enemy, we fall into the trap of unknowing, all on our own,
..and we make, what we discover later on to be, wrong decisions.
While we are making those decisions,
we are certainly making them with goodness in mind,
but without knowledge, good intentions may indeed, pave a way to hell.
This is something that has been known for thousands of years,
control of what is known is the evil behind slavery,
it is the evil behind manufactured consent.
And anything, that stands in the way of real education,
even broken schools, should be seen as an attack,
the theft of our intellectual inheritance.
Real Education must be seen as one of our Greatest Rights,
as a Great Treasure, a Great Honor, and Great Reward.
Failure to see that, is a sign that something has gone wrong,
and it is time to begin reading books on your own.
Be mindful of schools that are not educating you,
find your way to the library, read all the books that help you,
drop out, and carry on in Relentless Pursuit of Knowledge.
Know with full certainty,
that Dysfunctional Education, Neutered Education,
Education that fails to help you become Wise,
and Education that Makes You Feel Trapped, of Stupid,
is Fake Education!
It is a trick
that is robbing you of your right to knowledge and your path to greatness;
Find A library, find the Philosophy Section,
and find your beloved books there.
In the absence of teachers, you become a teacher,
learn, so that you may help others grow.
Humanity needs you to become a Great Being,
so that it too, can grow.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">To the question &#x201C;how far must I go&#x201D;,
there is but one answer, and it is never to be uttered quietly.
You must feel it and yell it,
yell it because every moment is a precious miracle.
So you yell: Higher!
Because higher is the answer, and it the only answer there ever was.
Higher, because we never know how far we need to go and grow,
so it is just is better, to keep going and never stop, ever, no matter how much you know.
Don&#x2019;t stop for bullies,
don&#x2019;t stop for teachers,
don&#x2019;t stop for the office,
don&#x2019;t stop for a career,
just fly right by.
Because, the first and foremost is to break out of all limits,
breach, each and every boundary, and rise right on top, over and over, and tip each tipping point.
Every book that makes Wise Beings smile,
read it, read it many times, record the good parts and play them back to sleep.
And then after your first ten or twenty books, or hundred books,
you write your own, and make it known.
And keep moving,
and don&#x2019;t stop,
because every wall must fall.
That A in class, that GPA in college, that Promotion and Office Window,
all of that has to go.
It is amazing to return to, from the great heights of your mountains,
but for now you go, because you are not a brick in that wall.
Find your limits,
and build your way out.
Our flaw is such, that we don&#x2019;t notice bad ideas that we are born around,
and if we keep growing into that life we will run aground.
All you need to do, is become a Great Being first,
then you can come back, and if you want it all, then you can have it all back.
...but first you grow, because without growing first, you&#x2019;ll never know which way to go.</span>

I looked out the window and it was entirely too dark,
I said, &quot;I hope I wont have to hide under a tree in some park.&quot;
As I made it to Ford Road it didn&apos;t seem that bad,
and then I felt the first three drops hit my head.
I decided to keep going as a proper health nut should,
and a quarter way through, I got soaked pretty good.
Just when I thought the clouds parted,
there was a grumble and the rain really started.
It rained heavy, but it didn&apos;t last very long,
I ran cheerfully feeling Mighty and Strong.
My biggest problem were the geese,
where I come from it is a fierce creature that knows no peace.
When I was a child they chased me and would often hiss,
but the ones by the Mall seem to be loving and full of bliss.
I was a beautiful day, without a doubt,

There are so many ways to inherit wisdom.
But, the best we can do, in chaos, and noise, and haste, and poverty, is books.
The stories of Wisdom in Lectures and Audio Books,
and the Super Humanity they bring to us.
To the Cries of the Philosophers,
the schools have become heartless machines.
Processing plants, pushing humans along,
to more poverty, more stress, more sacrifice, more achy bones.
Just, say, no, because you are not that simple, and your life is too precious,
just say no to the ordinary, to the plain, to the push along, play along, force fed mornings.
Go to the library, find a way to find all the Audio Books that will move you,
go to the beach and just listen how each and every great being rejected that ordinary life.
Oh, it cost them all the worthless grades, and all the office space and windows one could ever wish for,
but it granted them Freedom, Greatness of Mind, Vastness of Oceans, and Content of Character.
Please, break away from the ordinary life,
it is just a play along, live along fantasy meant to lull you to sleep.
You are meant to be a Force of Nature,
a Wave of Change, of Aspiration and Inspiration.
Do not go quietly into old age, do not let years and decades pass you by, they only move one way,
take to books and adventures, sleep by lakes, travel by boat, by bicycle, swim and distance run.
Do not let a moment go by, tick by irreplaceable tock, sleep in the storm and awake to thunder,
may each and every irreplaceable moment of your life become a shiny little precious gemstone.
You must become a great being,
do not let the ordinary life trick you, Greatness it is your Right!</span>

Learning helps us rise above our limits, and it sets us free from misperceptions.
Learning requires that we progress in layers, that we build upon our existing knowledge.
We can only grow more knowledgeable when we build a comfortable little road of delicate achievements.
Learning requires happy curiosity, enjoyment, satisfaction, and distant horizons.
The best kind of education is beautiful, colorful, enriching, and joyful.
Calm, joy, happiness and Love of Life, is the is the secret of genius.

We have to be very careful to avoid toxic environments that push us into hoop jumping, or worse yet cause fractures and breed distrust towards education.
In schools of today, we can only really memorize, jump the hoops and follow their rules. That&apos;s not Education, that&apos;s more like role play.
Education is too important to play games with.
Spending years pretending to get educated, is only going to earn your teacher money and grant you debt.
You will get older and poorer, and make your make-believe-teachers look more legitimate.
Just say no; choose Authenticity and Self Education, at your own happy pace with the books you love and teachers you admire.
Learn on your own, listen to Audio Books and Lectures, choose happiness.
Learning is sacred, choose adventure, choose genius.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">You can&apos;t leap into whatever you conceive Enlightenment to be,
it is built layer by layer, step by step, and year by year.
We all need might, never has a creature been alive that didn&apos;t need strength,
and waiting until the last moment; is a bad idea, anyway.
That&apos;s why people run marathons,
this is why people challenge themselves with practice.
So that when life becomes a challenge,
for all the finish lines they crossed, failure won&apos;t cross their mind.
A self challenge, is a practice of strength,
it is good for us.
It is different challenges for different people,
at different places in their lives.
But there is one thing they all have in common,
whatever they set off to do, it seems impossible at first.
That&apos;s what the hard parts of life are like,
they seem like an impassible challenge at first.
Practice makes us strong,
difficult challenges help us grow, and help us think too.
It is all for life,
it is all for enlightenment.
It is all for living above the common levels of life,
it is all for knowing that no matter the challenge, we will find a way.
May we all grow wise, and strong, and healthy,
may we each find a mountain to move and inspire a generation.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">There are tipping points in your intellectual development,
where you go from careful observation to certainty of knowing.
You build one thing on top of the other,
it becomes your Temple of Knowledge.
If you are correct about it all,
then the more you add the more you understand.
To learn for real,
we need fascination.
And we need freedom to move between curiosities,
and there are no divisions of subjects here.
We may learn numbers from calculating how many potential exoplanets our radio signals reached,
or we may trade mathematical notation for computer programming-languages where we can bring numbers to life.
Then quickly leap to Astrophotography, and learn about Biology from books written by Astrobiologists,
Enlightenment is not just about what we target precisely, but also what we learn along the way.
Enlightenment is Life, it is going round and round, and higher and higher,
through all these tiny twisty passages of Curiosity and Fascination to Discover more and more Light.
There is no need to divide Enlightenment from Wisdom and Knowledge,
but we must make a strong division between Real Education that brings results,
and Fake Education that makes you unhappy, exhausted, stressed.
Because unhappiness, exhaustion and stress,
will stop you from growing up, from becoming wise and enlightened,
from becoming an inspiration and helping the world grow a little.
It is a scary thing to aim away from everything we&apos;ve been taught to want,
but you are you and not what someone tells you to be
...and you are supposed to be much more courageous than merely taking your own path in life,
we can&apos;t live like quiet little mice just to be nice.
We have too much imagination, too much passion and inspiration, foresight insight and vision,
we are not to live ordinary lives.
We are Thinking Humans!
We are to live Lives of Inspired Enlightenment.
Because that&apos;s what furthers Human Kind the most,
because that is part of what is best within us.
Human Kind must grow in Wisdom and Enlightenment,
each of us is more than capable of becoming a Great Being.
When we grow the Wold Grows With Us,
let us make this world a better place for us all.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">The only thing keeping us back, is lack of wisdom,
this is occurring because the world places no emphasis on becoming wise.
Without wisdom we can&apos;t even tell if education is real or not,
...the mark of a real education are real results.
Without wisdom we can&apos;t tell what real results even are,
without wisdom we begin repeating old mistakes.
People say fake news - nope,
but it is actually the fake education...
Real education, helps a person become Wise and Noble,
Triumphant, Successful, Strong, Unbreakable.
In the real world no one ever celebrates graduation,
because Real Education is about a Dignified, Realistic Success.
If all students get is a Diploma and a Laboratory,
or even Debt and a job they didn&apos;t need a University for.
It is just a waste of time,
and time is priceless.
The central component of Real Education is Joy,
and satisfaction, and a sense of progression, and the undoing of the threat of poverty.
But without wisdom, it is hard to define poverty,
or satisfaction, or even what joy is supposed to mean in context of education.
Without wisdom, we are easily tricked that memorization has something to do with education,
we are easily tricked that confusion is just us not being good enough.
Memorization, is a cheap trick used by worthless teachers,
to pretend that they are doing something.
And by memorizing you make them appear legitimate,
you make them produce grades, and appear as teachers.
And that confusion is there because their lectures make no sense,
the text books probably don&apos;t make much sense either.
There is no conspiracy,
it is just people trying to fake it until they make it.
Many do have lessons they could teach you,
and just as many will keep them to themselves.
Just to appear smarter someday, or just out of spite,
&quot;Why should I tell them, it is not in the text book&quot;.
Lack of wisdom will keep a teacher, childlike,
keep them thinking &quot;this is just a job&quot;, &quot;it is us versus them&quot;,
and that usual &quot;I hate them&quot;, or &quot;hate my job&quot;.
There are good teachers out there,
but for all their goodness,
they know deep down in their hearts.
That it is easier for you to learn on your own adventures,
Then for them to try to help you understand what they know.
Learning is very intimate, and teaching what one knows is taking that intimacy,
and trying to reshape it for strangers.
Almost by definition this takes away all the passion,
all the value of the lessons.
Good Teacher,
may just be an Oxymoron.
It is your life, it must be your own path of discovery and self betterment,
no one can help you through this.
Learning languages, is something we do naturally,
not by memorizing but by becoming submerged in the language; by actually needing it for survival.
If you want to learn French,
head for the Colonies, inhale the language, don&apos;t memorize it.
Learning mathematics, is similar, you don&apos;t do it by memorization,
in Real Mathematics same symbols mean different things based on context and author.
To learn Math, you start in the beginning,
and slowly trace its development across Empires and centuries.
Whatever it is You Have To Love It,
can you imagine loving every mathematician?
Because that&apos;s what it takes to learn Math for real,
or Physics, or Chemistry, or Biology, or Astrophysics.
Now imagine trying to teach a stranger,
what you have learned, but without the love that you have personally felt for it.
Oxymoron.
Being good at Biology, Dancing, Medicine, Trail Running, Math, Electronics, Art, Computers, Music,
still means little.
We get good at things we like,
it is not a big deal to be good at something.
Being Wise, is a Big Deal,
being able to Authentically and Nobly navigate live in a Dignified Fashion.
With wisdom, we can figure out how the world works,
the World is not a Mechanical Machine, now will it ever become a Political One,
it is a Conundrum of Human Conditions.
All else must yield,
it must.
It must,
until you are touching the fabric of the future with your very own fingertips.
Until,
you feel like a hero.
Until it is your voice, and your soul, and heart, and your works,
and your strength.
That make him, rise,
with certainty of knowing, you are correct.
Tired old man,
who has seen everything and heard every lie.
He&apos;s been a District Judge for more than he can remember,
but he has heard every world yo said.
And the moment you mentioned,
that it is Human Rights Day, he groaned.
And he stood downstairs,
keeping his hands warm with a cup of coffee.
And he stood there much longer than you could,
and it marked the end of his career.
But he never forgot your words,
because your words were filled with wisdom.
Because you searched for it,
because you fought for it.
Because you were courageous,
it all became crystal clear in your mind.
And more than moving a single judge,
you will grow to move a generation.
Grow to renew the search for meaning,
the Love of Wisdom.
You moved mountains,
you gave speeches long past your retirement.
As the cities of the future grew,
and as you grew.
And the life of wisdom made it so,
that your name and the symbols it stood for earned permanence in Human History.
Wisdom, is your right,
it is your first fight,
it is your greatest might.
Rise my friend,
rise to no end,
the world needs you to set the trend.</span>

outline their treasure and their national pride.
But reality is such,
that this does not matter much.
One can complain about this nation or that nation,
but that does not change the situation...
We are one,
one family under the sun.
Eventually Education, Foresight, Wisdom, and World Peace,
will bring us all together and the complaints will cease.
Until then, we must each remember that borders are useless,
they only divide and create a huge mess.
A border does not mark its people to be of any particular kind,
it only keeps different kinds of colorful groups apart.
It is not correct to be unhappy about a nation,
let us be unhappy about lack of safety, books and education.
Let us come together and stand against lack of Good Schools and Wisdom,
let us but complain about divisions and lack of peace and calm.
If there were no borders, there would be more friendship and love,
all nations United in Peace under the symbol of the white dove.
We are not different from one another,
a sister or brother from a different mother.
In the World of the Future we won&apos;t be divided at all,
people will forget why we needed a wall.</span>

learning slowly in many stages.
I begun in 1999,
and I am still learning new things about design.
All the programming languages changed many times,
but knowing the whole history is very useful at times.
I&apos;ve learned a lot from the command line,
to art, colors, design, and how to reach the finish line.
I am surprised how long it all took,
but with all I know I am sure I could write a whole book.
I still have to learn a bunch of stuff,
but it is not going to be very tough.
I mostly have to get all the colors, and glows to dance and blend,
I kind of left all the fun stuff for the very end.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Let the deans nod to the graduates that drink most coffee,
sitting with presidents and dignitaries,
let them smile that each passed their trial.
But you, Dear Mother, you take your child to the Library,
make it their Castle, make it their Home,
make it their Temple of Knowledge.
&quot;My Mother used to bring me here almost every day,
this is my Temple of Knowledge, this is my Forever Home.&quot;
Teach that non-fiction, especially Memoirs,
are the only safe way to grow up.
Keep them on a path to understanding of the simplest things first,
and the most important things second so that they may build an easy on-ramp for themselves.
Remind them, that all young mistakes have already been made countless times,
that all the lessons, answers, and hopes of prevention,
are to be found in sacred stories of Triumph and Disaster.
That there is little in blind following.
And that there is Everything in pursuit of Wisdom,
to join with the Greater Family of the Great Human Beings,
that came before us and are sure to follow.
That school is just a Dream,
of a Simpler Universe,
a melody sweetly played,
but not in tune.
That our mind at its most responsible,
is the Sole Institution that we require,
for Pursuits of Excellence and Higher Learning.
So as long as we love ourselves,
as long as we are compassionate to ourselves,
we can comprehend inside out, many times the knowledge,
of those who are taught, outside in.
Let the Temple of Knowledge,
shine its beacon and sound the bell,
each time the little ones need answers,
and each time they are ready to commit their own wisdom to History.
World Peace requires,
that each child today,
becomes a Great Being,
in the Greater Tomorrow.
World Peace has little to do with the unobtainable ceasefire today,
and has everything to do, with letting children grow up under blue skies,
without drone strikes, deafening echoes of explosions, bullet riddled walls, and detention camps.
May the Greatness of Your Vision, and Unbreakability of your Heart and Mind,
help the Unstoppable Children of today, become the Great Beings the Future Needs.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">We have to remind each other,
that change requires,
that you and I grow.
That we grow in strength,
that we grow in experience.
that we grow in knowledge.
That we grow in Wisdom,
that we grow in Foresight.
That we grow all the way up.
We can&apos;t afford expensive Universities,
we don&apos;t even have the time.
We don&apos;t really want to graduate from Brown,
or Harvard, or Yale.
What we really want, is to spend a semester at each,
and for our hard earned wisdom to count as much as their Curriculum and GPA.
It would be nice to give a graduation speech,
though, it wouldn&apos;t last for very long,
everyone is so busy on that day.
And what a drop in the ocean,
a few years will seem come our Golden Age of Wisdom.
We have to be heard, BEYOND, a mere graduation speech,
and we have to learn FAR BEYOND anything a class can teach us.
We can&apos;t afford to be students, not for a year, not for a day,
because we are born at a gallop, and onward; to become an unstoppable force of Nature,
AND CHANGE, Meaningful Change.
That means, your little High School poetry book,
makes it into the back pocket of Every High School Troublemaker and Dropout.
And they will rely on your Down To Earth Greatness, and Your Unlimited, Unconfined, Hard Earned Wisdom,
to get through their nights, and to cross to the hills,
and to begin their Unlimited Journey to Their Mountain Tops.
There isn&apos;t time for classroom experience,
there is only time for Wisdom, Love and a Meaningful Contributions.
Every new intellectual,
each new dreamer, poet, writer or orator hoping to help the world grow,
needs a far greater audience, and a greater runway for a greater wisdom,
than any University can provide.
The changes cannot come from the Policy Makers, or Impressive Dignitaries, or Inspired Professors,
they can only come form deep within each and every Human Being alive today, and all those that are yet to come,
standing - on their own - in relentless pursuit of Excellence and Wisdom, not Grades, or Prestige.
We don&apos;t need more laws, more prisons, talking heads, and deans,
we need to take to the audio books, video lectures, the internet,
and learn at a speed far greater than any curriculum can offer.
Begin recording your first audio book,
listen to what you know,
and where you need to know more.
Pull yourself up by your own shoelaces,
let Unrestrained Education take over.
Wisdom graded by the lives you touch,
by the disasters you avert,
by the wisdom you share.
Let us set fairy tales aside,
and let us accept responsibility for our own education.
And encouraging all we meet to do the same,
there can not be a greater Brand Name,
than a Wise Humanity.
The world needs our help,
it is a call far beyond what Universities can point us towards to.
The world needs all... the Humans to Graduate.
From the upcoming politicians with their over-inflated campaigns,
and research that relies on low education and short foresight of the voter.
To those of us, who didn&apos;t want to go to MIT, or Harvard,
because we felt it only hold us back, if not downright break our heart.
Universities are little promises meant for a smaller and happier world,
the world of today is far too big to be moved by mere graduates,
even if it was all the universities trying all at once.
Every Human Being requires an Outstanding Education,
one that empowers them to stand up against all the wrong in the world today.
With the light of Intellectual Inheritance worthy of The Noblest Independent Human,
and the light they themselves bring to the world come their Golden Age of Wisdom.
My Dear Reader,
may you learn, and piece together so much wisdom,
as to ignite a light so powerful that each and every child in the word,
from across all political borders and language barriers will visit you and listen,
and grow in wisdom with your lesson and enlightenment.
Let us part part with the idea of an exclusive University and brand name education (whatever that is),
and take to every book worthy of each of us,
and learn more, and faster,
and greater lessons than can be taught outside in.
Because today&apos;s challenges are greater than the solutions that anyone in particular can bring,
the solution is in all of us, reaching and mastering knowledge and wisdom one by one.
The Protection of The Younger Generations from War, Poverty and Greed,
is the first and foremost, and must come as a result of a Wiser Humanity.
World Peace, and Human Rights,
are close second.
The Human Mind and Life is Too Sacred,
for little fairy tales of exclusive education.
Do not wait to be taught,
learn, and learn to no end in sight,
and when you know enough, share; and teach.
And may each Human Being,
grow to know that Wisdom, Growing All The Way Up, Greatness,
is neither optional, nor meant for the lucky few.
Let us accept the responsibility for Outstanding Self Education,
because for the world to grow; it is either all of us, or none.</span>
