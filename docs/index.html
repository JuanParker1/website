                      <span class="text-muted">Myths were invented to describe amazing people,
and I&apos;ve seen many amazing creatures in my journeys.
One time out in Nordhouse,
out of nowhere popped out a freshly graduated engineer.
He held up a gallon water container that was carrying back to camp,
and the poor mad lad uttered, &quot;8.34 pounds&quot;.
He seemed excited, but also sad,
and I think he was acting so odd because he realized he was forgetting everything.
Plus, I am certain he said pounds,
not kilograms; mad in deed.
Another time, at 6am or so, I was going through maps of south Pacific,
in Ann Arbor, by that strange black metal cube sculpture that squeaks when rotated.
I just had to get away from Ambrosia&apos;s morning clientele,
bless their hearts.
And I&apos;ve noticed that across the park some student was sleeping under an evergreen,
I don&apos;t think she worked in US, I just somehow assumed South America, Amazon.
She stared getting off the ground, and tried to yell that she wasn&apos;t homeless or drunk,
I kept looking into my maps, ignoring her; and she went on her way to get a grant, or give a speech or something.
I am sure she worked in South America,
probably with the natives.
Over in Ludington, there was this one time a little girl was feeding Seagulls with her mom,
and just as I noticed the commotion...
one of the Seagulls,
went, all, out!
Right in her hair,
I felt so bad, and her mother was only barely able to contain her laughter.
She puffed up her face as if playing a trumpet,
you could totally tell she had enough of that kid, and she was getting payback for all her hissy fits.
And then there is this... story that is most Dearest to me,
one of my happiest memories, that I swore I would never talk about because I am far too mature.
Alas, this is what All Hallows&apos; Eve is all about,
talking about strange creatures, and wonderful memories.
It was an beautiful early morning,
I was sitting by my breakfast fire.
Mostly listening to birds, and probably angry bears,
whilst squiggling in my journal, about poems, and programs.
This was a large and beautiful camp site full of tress,
they had clean showers, and proper restrooms.
I had the first camp site on the Orchid Loop,
and I noticed that a couple of giggly middle aged ladies were just getting into the spirit of camping.
They were always happy, and sophisticated,
and laughing, playing some smart radio station, and always full of joy.
This morning the tall one started shimmy shammying first,
she was probably getting around to starting up a fire to make breakfast.
They had all the firewood,
and swe was singing something, it was unusual for people to make so many happy little noises during a stay there.
She quieted down a bit,
and lit her fire.
And as she bent over to pick up some twigs to get things going,
she fired off that old familiar sound that one would expect from a constipated and uncultured, filthy, lactose intolerant old man.
And, oh my gosh,
all of a sudden all the birds went quiet.
It was just this unusual deafening silence,
and that&apos;s just half the story, because all of a sudden this sophisticated wealthy woman goes:
&quot;Puull my finga&quot;
In the worst fake southern accent she could possibly conjure up,
and with the longest drawl.
And then she quickly skedaddled back to her camper,
- probably to change, and lay down a bit.
This must have been ten years ago or more,
and I still haven&apos;t forgotten about it.
Happy Halloween,
Everyone.

                      <span class="text-muted">Some secrets are right there,
in the sand, they lay bare.
For a few days,
I, manned that blaze.
I lit a fire so great,
that it moved me, to create.
I didn&apos;t have much in my tent,
in my wallet, I didn&apos;t have a singe cent.
I lived in a castle, built by a gigantic dune,
its halls hummed that ancient tune.
In the day I&apos;d gather firewood,
come the eve I&apos;d have a potato, that tasted so good.
I neither searched for a beginning nor the end,
I merely wanted to find idea&apos;s edge, to my own content.
It was right there,
but it was not in the horizon, nor the fire&apos;s flare.
It was in living at a proper pace,
and sleeping in the right place.
The pace at which you live your days,
must match your interest, and remain, in phase.
Composing Music and Painting Art,
are unique and worlds apart.
In art we race to paint,
but in music we must practice restraint.
The eye can&apos;t see,
what the ear can hear.
Though both require layers to become thick,
paintings rain, while music goes tick by tick.
Each requires a different place,
and a walk about at a distinct pace.
There are many out there that move all wrong,
sadly, they will never finish their painting, or their song.
And when it was time go back whence I came,
I rolled up my tent, and put out the flame.
Somebody else down the trail, instantly lit another fire,
and pondered their own wisdom, to their own desire.
I waddled back, my painted walking stick in hand,
slowly marking notes, beats, and measures in the sand.
Now, whenever I try to learn something new,
I wait for time to give me a clue.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Invent everything,
we are all extremely smart.
We can learn anything,
so as long as we don&apos;t skip any steps along the way.
And so as long,
as all steps are interesting and fun to us.
Never force yourself to learn something you don&apos;t enjoy,
just keep reading books, and keep looking for something to strike your fancy.
From Dreaming, and Inventing,
to Art, Programming and taking to the skies.
An invention can be as simple,
as an LED Throwie or LED Glowie.
Just a Light Emitting Diode, a battery and magnet,
to keep it all together; and as a bonus make it stick to metal surfaces.
That is a three component invention,
LED, magnet, battery.
My favorite Radio Astronomer,
Seth Shostak.
Quips, that the baseline for determining if a member of a species is intelligent,
is whether or not it can hold a soldering iron, and make a radio.
Allow me to get you soldering a radio,
as quickly as possible.
Get a Raspberry PI Zero W (the W stands for Wireless or &quot;with WI-FI&quot;),
a soldering kit, a solder wick, some GPIO headers,
and a 4 x 8 RGB LED HAT that fits a Raspberry PI Zero neatly.
Look everything up on YouTube,
how to solder, how to solder headers, how to use a solder wick.
This is serious business,
in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.
Though get a $30 kit
that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.
At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,
and set it up on the network.
But later as you figure everything out,
you unplug everything leaving just the power.
To get inside it,
you use a remote terminal.
Once you login,
you get a command prompt.
It listens to words, to commands,
very similar to adventure games.
Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,
are very much like rooms in a game.
To get inside Documents,
type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;
The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,
Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.
When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,
you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.
The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,
just a couple of words and nothing more.
But sometimes, that is not enough,
like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.
We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,
we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.
You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,
it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.
To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,
which is short for list, or list files.
&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,
you can ask it for help like above.
But also ask it to list files in a long format,
by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,
the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.
To list files with readable file sizes,
you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;
Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,
the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,
you just use the short versions.
The command line interface is trying to be your friend,
it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.
There are many tutorials on how to use the command line,
and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference
Here are instructions on how to play audio through HDMI,
your monitor should have an audio out somewhere.
Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,
and try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights based on this tutorial.
Alternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on this instructable,
note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.
And there is also a Raspberry PI WH,
meaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.
And now, get a $10 camera,
and use raspistill to take a photo,
and play around with all the other options.
Now you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,
a programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.
You can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,
you can get an LCD screen and turn it into a tablet.
Raspberry PI is not the only Single-board computer,
PINE looks really nice as well.
If you are looking for a more complicated project,
perhaps try building a Raspberry PI Drone,
bonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.
We have no limits,
but we are also very unique.
Our inventions need not rely on commuters,
some of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.
Don&apos;t let anybody stop you from inventing,
and don&apos;t stop dreaming.
Finally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,
make for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.
Aim,
for the Moon.

                      <span class="text-muted">Of course, it is not just aging,
but is it also more than just learning.
Some say &quot;Lean into the discomfort.&quot;,
others &quot;Don&apos;t try go all the way.&quot;.
It is all about building ourselves,
layer by layer.
The layers,
need not always be on the same subject.
You may start an artist, or a dreamer, or a mechanic,
and then move to urban explorer, photographer, and islander.
The steps we take are slightly different,
from what we take away.
An artist learns the harmony of colors,
the strange simplicity of desaturating colors by mixing opposites.
The dreamer learns that a dream is not just a dream,
because if you snag on it and carry it out, it will become true.
The mechanic learns about a screw,
if you tighten it too much you will ruin it.
The urban explorer learns that the attorney,
that left his stuff behind was always suffering and died alone.
The photographer learns that it is the journey,
and the photo is a mere bookmark in memories.
And the islander,
ohh, the islander.
Finally, when the golden age of wisdom and endless aches and grunts comes,
the islander learns that life is to be lived fully.
And what that means, is that we take what we learned from the day before,
mix it with today, and get it ready to mix it with tomorrow.
Like a waterfall that runs into to the ocean,
the new things we learn add to the body of the old.
With old age being a privilege denied to so many,
the treasure we carry truly becomes magnificent as we move forth.
We can&apos;t learn all at once,
and we can&apos;t fully learn through synthetic means.
At schools the curriculum is so warped,
it can only be dishonestly memorized.
Audio Books and Lectures, go a long way,
so as long as you make room for the lessons within.
Education requires room, here there can be no stress from grades,
no craziness for a high GPA, brand name education, and a promise of a job.
We need life, we need the full thickness of life,
and then an urge to study will emerge.
That thick life,
will move us.
It will uncover an absence of knowledge,
and it will feel great to fill it right up with precisely 14 books on the subject.
A synthetic education born from being forced to learn,
is a very poor education.
Memorization,
is not an education at all, it is actually dangerous and stupid.
And networking with grads from a brand name university to get stuff done,
has nothing to do with getting educated, it is a service trading club.
Learning from books,
whilst walking a huge trail filled with Bobcats and Mountain Lions,
is far superior of a teacher than anything claiming to educate today.
And one of the best things about books,
is that they make mistakes sometimes.
Their authors get so inspired,
that their ideas sometimes take off and fly in the sky.
And when you catch a famous Author on such a flight of fancy,
you learn even more, you learn about Excellence.
(And how useless, and desperate, and child like book critics are.)
Medical Schools are not an exception here,
textbooks are important, practice even more,
but so is healing a person on the inside, within their mind.
We can all imagine an excellent doctor, extremely professional,
perfect grades, well read, awesome person all around, no complaints.
And we can imagine what it is like to suffer without hope,
and seeing this kind individual, just move on to the next patient.
See, being a perfect Doctor, is not enough,
the surgery is not over when the procedure is done.
And people can tell when someone merely follows etiquette,
and merely pops in for a moment to say something nice, and be done with it.
Be it a Doctor, Scientist, Musician, Artist,
Dreamer, Adventurer, Rebel, even Beloved Professor...
...more is needed.
Greatness of heart,
is a really good start.
But, I think the golden standard of Life and Art,
is; Vastness of Heart.
There is no describing it, but these Beautiful Beings,
smile, and laugh, no matter the weather,
And when they speak, they seem to be part of Cosmos,
not just Earth.
A Mechanic who borrows from his work,
for purposes of Wisdom.
Will hold up a screw,
and say.
&quot;In order for this important piece of the system to do its job,
you have to know when too much of tightening the screw will damage it.&quot;
This is a good example of what we see in schools,
Elementary is a Dream, Middle School kind of works,
but creating High School by just making subjects more demanding, is insane.
The screw is tightened,
damaged, and now, it cannot be repaired.
At the very least, we must help the children to create a start-up,
to work together on building 3D printed inventions, learning Linux, and coming up with new stuff.
And help them setup a way of charging customers,
a way of advertising products, and wipe their fears of poverty.
The kids, are always smarter than us,
they build on top of what we have built.
We are not giving them the tools for their future,
we teach pure Trigonometry and this cannot be dumber.
Because to teach Trigonometry,
all the teacher has to do is create a class about
building games that get published on Steam (game store).
What a teacher may not do,
is force feed pure triangle garbage to people who don&apos;t have an interest in it.
It is not hormones (and no teacher should ever say that), students simply stop listing,
when they figure out the teachers are... selling them out for a paycheck.
Dreamers are my favorite,
here is someone who sits down and thinks up the following,
&quot;If I was born on a different continent,
to a different religion, I would be asked to worship that other god that I am told is false.&quot;
&quot;Furthermore,&quot; - and you know there is always a furthermore,
that&apos;s part of the reason why they cannot be stopped.
&quot;Aren&apos;t we all atheists,
to all the other gods.&quot;
And just when you think she was done with it,
she adds &quot;Why don&apos;t we go the extra step and love All Life, All Wisdom, All Good Ideas, and All Human Beings&quot;
And the next thing you know,
you realize she was never a Dreamer, nor was she ever little.
She&apos;s a Philosopher.
To tell children, that there exists a group of Universal Beings,
that dedicate their lives and immortality to Wisdom,
and passing it on to all the future generations,
is to help them grow from the highest of mountains.
And the Urban Explorer,
they see homes after the families left.
They see pictures,
and smiles, and forgotten hopes.
They see passage of time,
they see the motion of generation upon generation.
They can see the homes as they were on Christmas,
and they can read the medical bills scattered in the corner.
These so called scoundrels,
often chased away like dogs.
They are working on wording a lesson,
that they hope to voice some day.
Maybe come their golden age,
as Guggenheim shows their works.
They will speak of leaving bad ideas behind,
and sharing in all the good ones.
How truly precious all our daily chores,
how it is these little ordinary moments that add to create almost all our lives.
&quot;There are no ordinary moments&quot; as Dan Millman says.
Layer by layer, and the sequence will come deep from within the heart,
and it will reveal it self by means of curiosity.
When a day comes, and you find yourself looking out the window,
with more pleasure than than writing games or interactive fiction,
or managing your corporation, or putting out fire tornadoes.
Deep from within your heart,
a new curiosity calls to you.
And it can only make you better,
better at what you do, help you climb higher than the height you are on right now.
You don&apos;t have to switch careers,
but you do need to throw a loaf of bread into your back pack.
And hit the trail.
If you are out east Section Hike the Appalachian Trail,
if you are out west than hike the Pacific Crest Trail,
if you are out in the Pacific then set of for the Kalalau on the island of Ka&apos;uai.
Bring your Audio Books,
and make no mistake,
Because the end of that trail,
marks only the beginning of your new adventure.
Remember the aim, my friends:
Vastness Of Heart!</span>

there is something you should know.
Put on your mittens, and a hat,

But don&apos;t drive back home, just turn south on 275,
and drive.
We&apos;re going all the way down,
to take care of your frown.
You&apos;ll drive through Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
right till you get to good old Georgia.
Here you stop, and get some sleep.
but wake up early, cause we got a pace to keep.
Drive all the way through Florida to US Highway One,
and be ready to catch some sun.
Get to Little Duck Key,
and park beneath a palm tree.
Now, squirt some suntan lotion.
and enjoy the Ocean.

will only keep causing trouble for as long as we are unaware of them.
Eventually, new, fully functional educational systems,
will help us to Knowledge and Wisdom.
As we learn to trust computers,
we will learn to stop relying on easily corruptible career politicians.
The educated voter democracies of the future,
will stand as powerful machines helping us manage our cities and Earth with the wisdom of the crowds.
The world before us lost 99% of its species,
the climate is ever changing.
The layer of oxygen we all rely on is extraordinary thin,
and most of earth is Ocean and the rest requires that we protect ourselves from elements.
While we are bound to this planet chemically,
Earth never really relied on us for anything.
We are not the destroyers, not is Earth,
we are simply yet to be fully awakened caretakers and maintainers.
We need a more powerful educational system,
one that reaches deep into all corners of Humanity,
From Yawanawa, Romani, Maasai, Samoyeds, Rotumans, and Hawaiians,
we all have to come together now as a single family.
What must connect us, is education,
which is just a path to Knowledge and Wisdom.
Whoever we are, and whatever we think we are doing,
we are made much better by inheritance of Knowledge and Wisdom,
which in turn begets Compassion, and Empathy, and the very cure for our Cognitive Biases.
The Love of The Human Family,
and the Insight and Understanding it entails.
It is OK to have made mistakes,
it is just our cognitive biases,
and lack of education, and poverty, and fear.
But it is not OK to stay within the confines of those mistakes,
Earth needs our help, the animals need our help too,
and we can&apos;t help them without Education and the Unity it entails.
All it will take is Storytellers and Lovers of Science and Knowledge,
and Narrators, reading it all in the many languages.
May this century,
become The Century Of The School.
A tiny Audio Player, perhaps a solar powered School on a Chip,
or free access satellites that truly bring the internet to all.
We don&apos;t have to Love All Humanity at first,
just the Tigers, the Big Pussy Cats, 3,890 left,
let us come together now, let us help Earth and all of her inhabitants.
And where education leads,
the nations will follow.

We learn a new language out there,
the edge grants us a new vocabulary.
A vocabulary, is also an aid for thinking,
it helps us navigate better.
And the edge is a sacred place,
there you can quietly comprehend what all Great Beings speak of.
And, it becomes your anchor,
the thing that makes sense.
it becomes the point from which you measure other things,
as you progress forward.
And, Look who else is here,
the Elder You.
They all come here, at every plateau, in each great loneliness,
ask them what their regrets are, and prevent them all from occurring.
The edge is a sacred place,
you are always safe out here, you are always welcome, and you are never alone.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">It is not &quot;the secret to happiness&quot;,
it is that happiness; is the secret.
Happiness is the true human superpower.
Sure, we can push through anything,
and adapt to everything.
But, in happiness,
our might multiples to no end.
And happiness can&apos;t be faked,
happiness depends on authenticity.
I think it is the key to learning,
adventuring, exploring, and discovering.
It is the key to invention, to creativity,
to becoming a force of nature.
Happiness puts us up,
on the highest of levels of existence.
Right up there with distant supernoveae,
quasars, neutron stars, and stellar nurseries.
On par with the Universe,
contributing something the quarks and quasars can&apos;t.
I am certain, we only have one flaw,
just a small stupid mistake
One that that can be easily avoided,
so as long as we remind each other about it.
We accept what we are born into as a standard,
and along with it we accepts the false leaders as well.
If the culture and its leaders are headed for a black hole,
we have an overwhelming tendency to blindly follow.
We have to grab each other, with Art, Music, Poetry,
with Doodles and Graffiti, Hugging, Shouting, and Howling.
Grab each other by the ears and whisper,
whilst gently rocking the head in every direction.
&quot;Do not go gentle into that good night,
rage, rage, against the dying of light.&quot;
And when we snap out of that gravitational pull,
we must begin our journey up, all the way up.
Nobody knows,
what comes first.
Healing, Leadership.
Love of Live, Joy of Being,
Love, Happiness, Wisdom,
Greatness, Enlightenment.
Authenticity, Dignity, Nobility,
Courage, Valor, Honor, Heroism.
Adventure, Content of Character, Strength and Unbreakability,
Fortitude, Foresight, Understanding, Insight.
Creativity, Invention,
Dance and Rebellion.
I suppose no one knows which comes first because it all comes at once,
all of those marvels are one, indivisible, part of Being Human.
We must avoid what Dear Sir Ken Robinson refereed to as,
Taking Things for Granted.
We must avoid assuming that something is true,
without thinking about it, without questioning it.
We must resist self-indoctrination into cultures,
that we are merely born into.
Only when we break away from that dark thoughtless path,
will we be able to freely grow and rise up.
Only on our way up,
will we find Happiness, and the other Marvels.
And although this century will be a challenging one,
when we face it upright.
Enabled by the marvels that makes us Human, and on par with the universe,
we will rise, and learn, and become wiser for it.
We have lost ten tigers, in recent weeks,
we are down to 3890 tigers.
The Tragedy of the Big Pussy Cats,
is one way, that the universe is helping us rise.
Remember, first you must learn to resist indoctrination,
resist taking things for granted, resist following leaders you don&apos;t know,
resist the fallacy of choosing the lesser evil.
And second, you must take to books,
self educate by falling in love with Humanity&apos;s most celebrated works.
With each step upwards towards becoming a great being,
you will gain more and more abilities.
And third, Educated Humanity,
is a United Humanity.
To repeat one of the quotes by Robert Ardrey that Sir Ken Robinson was fond of,
&quot;...We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels,
The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk
but how magnificently he has risen.
We are known among the stars by our poems...&quot;</span>

You can learn the Melbourne Shuffle nearly instantly,
if you start with Alan Walker&apos;s Faded.
There is a springy sound in between the beat past the intro,
that&apos;s where you contract your core, that&apos;s the middle step,
that divides mere shuffling feet; from actual Melbourne Shuffle.
The only other thing you have to remember,
is that the leg you lift goes forward, and then you switch legs.
The sound controls your body,
start with a slower song or a different genre and it will be a lot harder,
for a person who is just starting, it may be too hard to try to dance to a different song.
And music is basically a program,
it is just Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies assembled into a song.
You can easily break down Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies into their structure,
you can hear it in your ear, you can write it down on paper, in color, with squiggles and emphasis.
But there is a better way, even better than LMMS,
and that is programming.
A song you program can play forever,
and the programming language that you learn along the way, is actually a method for interfacing with technology,
The GUI is a very slow method of controlling computers,
the command line, automation of the command line, and writing commands you can use and automate,
is the first, and really the only way to get computers to work for us, not against us.
And on the other spectrum, you can write a program,
that will control your dance, the very way you move.
It is all connected, Sam Aaron is correct in his analogy,
we don&apos;t learn to write to become book authors, we just need it,
and we don&apos;t learn programming to sit in an office cubicle all day long,
We do it to save day,
to save some time,
and to dance that time away.

My first independent invention was a CD based Car MP3 player in 1998,
there were many other mp3 player patents, dating many years back, I didn&apos;t invent anything new.
My second invention about 10 year later, was a freaking star-ship,
and it was safe to teenagers fly.
It was a high altitude balloon with a miniature craft that would beam down video and movement of the platform,
to a trailer down on the ground where the crew would be experiencing all the motion in near real time.
Once the balloon pops it would be possible to the dismay of the FAA, and evey other three letter agancy,
to attempt to stair it, the kids in the trailer on the ground would be getting real feedback to whatever the heck they were trying to do.
Once someone slams the deploy parachute button,
the miniature craft would slow its descent, the trailer would shudder.
My third invention, from just not too far back was a board game,
but a fascinating one.
Amazon sells see through acrylic padlocks, and deadbolts for locksmith training,
and I realized that one could create a little game out of them.
Basically the players would have to lock-pick their way through the game,
they would each receive a little lock picking kit, which is the real deal.
As a bonus the last door they would have to pick,
was the door to their own house.
This would teach the players to find a quality lock,
and actually help them in real life.
And just now, I am toying with the extremely CPU intensive post processing of photographs,

but I can also see that it could control a large array of cameras and I am just wondering what that could mean for slow motion,
super resolution, and things like home made supernovae detection software.
It is all fun and games, I am hardly programming any of this, and it is all just about as unscientific as it can be,
but it does help with day dreams, having a bold idea, and looking into it, teaches something.
This kind of exploratory learning, or self education,
if far more powerful than reading textbooks, or listening to lectures.
Do not be afraid of imagining interesting things,
take to the microscope, infrared and thermal imaging.
I think self education is the only way to make the world a better place,
treat school for what it is, and don&apos;t let it stand between you and real knowledge, and fun.

                      <span class="text-muted">I think that is how the great thinkers learned in the past,
they would grab onto something like Gravitation, Electromagnetism, Pendulums,
and try to figure out how they worked, what forces influenced the things they observed.
Inventing and Invention, makes us think of Pet Rocks, Chia Pets, and Cheap Junk,
but the true meaning of invention is following your path of curiosities.
For example, aren&apos;t you curious about Infrared Photography?
Infrared Lamps that but emit a faint red color, but light up an IR Photo,
Infrared Camera for Raspberry PI Zero costs $12, and the UNIX based Raspberry PI Zero just about $20,
Raspberry PI contains a couple commands with dozens of options that you can tinker with,
from ISO, shutter speed, to options like brightness and contrast.
Just a simple curiosity can lead you on a path of exploring UNIX,
Photography, the Light Spectrum, and even let you brush against Astrography.
Where you get to think about flaws in your Charge Coupled Device (CCD Sensor),
and how you have to hunt down and eliminate the dead pixels.
And what great please it is to see that your photos are flawless,
and then begin stacking them to average out and remove noise,
all these little triumphs add to your Knowledge and Wisdom.
It is OK to be overwhelmed, but it is not OK to shy away from something that captured your interest because it seems too confusing,
the confusion just comes from not knowing all the steps to get to taking your first IR photo.
Start with the $150 8GB Raspberry PI 4, get a couple of monitors,
and create your first laboratory.
Then get the $20 Raspberry PI Zero, and you&apos;ll have your first computer network,
with a satellite Raspberry Zero, that only requires power, so it just needs a single cable.
Attach the Noir Camera to it,
and start exploring what it means to average images to eliminate noise.
Another Raspberry Zero,
this time with a normal $9 camera, can watch your flowers with time laps photography.
This is an example of a modern path of invention,
from this point on, you get to choose your own next steps.
You can study Node.js, UNIX, Bash, and become a programmer,
you can move on beyond the digital and buy your first $200 DIY 3D Printer,
and for example print cases for your Raspberry PIs.
After some practice with the servo motors,
you can build a Raspberry Powered Telescope,
that also doubles as a Deadly Space Laser, hey you never know, it is 2020 after all.
This is how the Great Beings that invented the experiment of mandatory public education, learned.
Baby Step, by Baby Step.
traveling a decades long journey with with curiosities and adventures.
A journey where every new step adds to the previous,
to create a body of Knowledge and Wisdom.
When you feel you hit a milestone, write a tutorial on how you did it,
on what you improved, make some video tutorials, and put them on your resume,
show your inventors or employer that you know that your mind has no limits,
and that you are a Brilliant Inventor, and a Fine Scientist.

                      <span class="text-muted">You are a great inventor, invention is something we do naturally,
but you need to detox from all the hustle and bustle of busy life.
Your private inventions usually build on something someone else did,
so social networks, websites, photography, and maybe art.
If you just sit down with something that fascinates you,
and play with it, you are bound to invent something new.
Let us start with a silly example,
You could create a custom phone ring service, where people yell names...
so when someone calls Alan, the phone actually screams for him.
And here your invention would be about how your relate to voice artists, what tools you give them,
would you also create an addition where the phone yells the name of the person that is calling.
Something more serious would be a social network that takes all your weekly posts,
and creates a part of a chapter in your memoir, here the users can order a paper hard copy,
you could customize this idea by providing beautifully bound books that feature posts from many users,
and you may even simply rely on existing social networks.
Not all starting points require the internet,
or complexity for that matter.
Do you know about Spin Art,
if you could invent a personal touch, maybe something to do with 3D features, or thread,
every Dentist&apos;s Office would feature your fantastic art, your signature, and website address,
and you could even publish a coffee book about your art.
For something less abstract consider building a tilt-shift photography service,
where you get a little drone to fly up to get a giant&apos;s view, and take the most fascinating photos,
for weddings, real-estate, even newspaper articles.
For something more startling, you could start with macro photography,
now entering a realm that everyone can&apos;t help but to be fascinated with,
enormous six foot canvas featuring tiny bugs.
You could even go deeper and do Photomicrography,
and here you enter a world that very few people think about, some may even find your photos unbelievable,
this kind of work would get you featured in national galleries.
If you don&apos;t like still photography, consider setting up cheap time laps cameras all over the place,
and then sell them as background video for speeches, or poetry, or add classical music and call it a new way to hear it,
or call it the study of passage of time, and make a documentary about it, to get at your first Oscar.
Not all inventions need to make money or fame,
but all inventions must fascinate you.
They have to call to your soul,
to your health, to your curiosity.
You have thousands of ideas in your mind,
slow down, get in touch with your Inventive Side,
and help the world become more beautiful.

                      <span class="text-muted">My Friends,
No century is ordinary, and such is the case with this one,
you have a little bit of work to do, you may need to slow down with school and work a bit.
You will be creating a series of books about Real Education, Governing the World,
Human Rights, and a beautiful Survey Course half-jokingly entitled, The Human Manual.
Today computers are everywhere, and they hold a powerful potential,
one that can enhance Education, The Voter and Democracy,
one that can simplify bureaucracies and Governments.
Humanity has been greatly enhanced by the experiment of mandatory education and free access to knowledge,
but the systems of standardized education have fallen behind on times,
we must now use computers to cater to individual students,
and to remove the need of grades, replacing it with a simple history of self chosen subjects.
This a great endeavor,
for which few are ready.
As it always happens in Human History,
this challenge has been pressed upon our shoulders all too soon,
it has been accelerated by Climate Change, Anthropocene Extinction, Mass Incarceration,
and Needles Borders that uselessly Divide our Human Family.
This century a Divided Humanity is a Weak Humanity,
to face all the challenges and to ready the Younger Generations to carry on,
we must unite, the Internet has been Ready for years now.
What follows is an imperfect outline,
of much needed works that aim to Strengthen Humanity,
and help all the children with all the challenges they are soon to face.
Book One: Real Education,
this is a choose your own adventure type experience, that is to be published as a Paper Book,
as an Audio Book, as a Video Book, and finally taught in schools as a series of lectures.
This is very important, My Friends, in 2020, at the time of writing this document,
schools were unable to teach students, they would only force them into memorization,
the motive was to receive state funding so that all school employees would get paid.
(Much will be said on this subject, but much of it won&apos;t matter,
because efficacy of education is _not_ judged by its collective test scores and trends,
but rather; results. Its positive impact on the Voter, and City, State, and Nation Governments,
and above all the well being of our Planet.)
Book Two: Governing The World,
is a book about establishing a Computer Program Managed Democracy,
it is very much an augmented reality, a mirror of our world where our voices count for more.
The program harnesses the Wisdom of the Educated Humanity;
for City, State, Nation, and Earth management.
It is worth noting that it is to have its beginnings as a Interactive Fiction game,
that is collaboratively expanded, much like the world encyclopedia.
Book Three: Human Rights,
is a volume detailing stories about growing up in the world,
it is just essays that highlight what people can do to help the World Grow,
and how to go about it to become triumphant.
This book speaks about a path to a United Humanity,
it is not just about putting an end to the idea of borders as the European Union so nobly demonstrates,
but it is about getting ready to commit all ideas that result in dividing us to history books,
and accepting the fact that we are just one family, that we are the Wise Caretakers of Earth and all of Her Inhabitants.
Human Rights must also highlight the problem of inequality that leads to Incarceration,
people are going to prisons due to lack of Education and Knowledge.
Due to Stress, Poverty. Mental Disorders and Illness some of which is rooted in Neurological Disorders born from poverty, addiction, and unsafe environments.
Prisons must be replaced with Schools,
Human beings do not belong in cages.
Furthermore,
The first and foremost purpose of a Government is to end poverty, homelessness, hunger, and sickness to the best of our abilities.
This means a Universal Basic Income, real money indistinguishable from a paycheck earned by hard work.
People who face Poverty, Hunger, Homelessness, treatable Illness,
who feel isolated or excluded, will be unable to study and comprehend these great Works of Love that this text describes.
We are One Family, we need their help, we need all of Humanity to permanently come together and leave bad ideas behind.
Book Four: The Human Manual,
Is a Book of world&apos;s most inspirational and beloved essays.
It contains the following;
cheerful chapters for Mighty Five Year Olds,
inspiring essays for the Unstoppable Ten Year Olds,
a loving introduction to the complexity of the world for Fifteen Year olds,
and powerful and moving lessons for Teenagers and Twenty-somethings, lessons that many Thirty and Forty Year olds will lovingly return to.
These works are not meant to be set in stone,
the doors to new essays, submissions, and repairs, will always be open.
They are to be translated into all the languages spoken today,
in order to encourage global communication and unity.
These works, are works of the Universal Human Love,
of Human Beings finally coming together to form a Single United Family.
As a United Humanity,
we can easily face all the challenges ahead.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">If loneliness, school, or work has you stressed out,
and in haste you are slowly forgetting where your lines are.
Here&apos;s a bit of magic for you,
it will help you separate who you are, from what you choose to do.
Keep a backpack by your front door,
make sure it is always stuffed full of goodies and ready to go.
Even if it is autumn, or winter,
and there isn&apos;t anywhere to go.
Keep your backpack by the door,
it will remind you that you are free,
and you choose to work hard.
We mustn&apos;t forget that to really sleep,
we must be rested first, and then wait for the sunset.
To really wake up, we have to let our body decide,
we can&apos;t be ripped out of sleep by an alarm.
Each day, must count,
and add to the previous.
And make us stronger, and wiser,
and a bit healthier and overall, better.
If things ever get rough,
it is high time for adventure.
You drive home,
but don&apos;t turn off the car.
Pop in just to grab the backpack,
find a place with decent weather, and ride.
It will take you three days,
to pull your self back together.
And it will be really hard at first,
it will feel like you must go back.
But you can&apos;t live a life,
that is making you lose yourself in haste.
You need to pull yourself together,
and the first three days are the hardest.
The next three days,
will show you that you are returning to normal.
You will sleep longer,
it will feel like a deep breath.
And finally,
you will relax.
And here after a week or two,
you will feel much healthier.
Do not push yourself too hard,
you have to take good care of yourself.
People that care about you will appreciate your well-being,
much more than your hard work.
So, a backpack by the door,
and as a fantastic bonus.
You get to go shopping,
and shopping is the best form of mediation there is.
Start with mosquito repellent sticks that you light on fire,
keep them some distance away from your tent.
Figure out what poison ivy looks like and stay away from it,
leaves of three leave it be, but get some antihistamines and over-the-counter corticosteroid for other bites.
Bring an expensive solar battery charger,
and backup power-bank meant to recharge your specific cell phone a few times.
Audio books are critical, you must not forget.
make sure you at least have Bill Bryson&apos;s &quot;A Walk in The Woods&quot; and &quot;Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;.
Don&apos;t forget to get a good Rambo knife, or two, and preferably cut-proof gloves,
be careful, a sharp knife is often the most &quot;dangerous&quot; thing on your adventure.
You may need a large metal mug for cooking,
or a cooking-kit, often it is just better to sharpen a stick and have a sausage.
Adventure is the best time to practice your chopstick skills,
you&apos;ll never need a fork, if any old stick snapped in half will do.
Bring a fancy hat, and some mighty sunscreen,
don&apos;t let the sun get to you.
A trusty headlamp, with some extra batteries,
will help you in the dark, watch out for owls.
You will need a first aid kit,
duct tape is your friend here,
but get bandage and disinfectant too.
Matches, Zippo, and zippo lighter fluid,
here the fluid will double as fire starter,
and get some fire starter products like wax sticks and candles.
And you will need some para-cord,
for easily dragging firewood to your camp.
Get an inexpensive tent, there are some that are very light weight,
but you are laying down on the ground and your back may not like that.
Some people just travel with a lightweight hammock,
specifically crafted to replace a tent, so get both, and see which one works out.
You will need a sleeping bag,
I always bought the warmest ones.
Get a water-bottle,
and just in case get some water purification tablets.
Toothpaste, toothbrush,
and toiletries.
Always remember to dangle your food on a few feet of para-cord high up in a tree,
it will give the cute little Raccoons a workout, an you&apos;ll get to keep your food.
Raccoons are smart enough to fiddle with your tent zipper until they can get inside,
so get a tiny luggage padlock and lock the zipper eyelets together.</span>

                      <span class="text-muted">Living is Art,
so lift your brush to the canvas, Dear Friends.
Fatigue, overwork, imbalance, tiredness,
all conspire to keep us running in circles.
Especially, right before setting off on an adventure,
sometimes it takes up to a week, to remember who we are.
First couple of days, are the worst,
it feels like adventure is not worth it, and we need to go back.
Back to what?
And how many years has it been now?
Adventure is a cute upside-down word,
hoping to remind you that you are full of energy and sunshine.
That you are a professional troublemaker,
and a fancy bookworm.
As good as your poker face is, under stress,
Ohh, the sh*tstorm that you will sow and reap, with your beautiful and perfect deadpan comedy,
upon an unsuspecting fellow shopper, whilst waiting in the checkout line at the local Supermarket.
They won&apos;t *ever* know what hit them, and you will uncontrollably giggle all the way back to your car,
whilst crunching the ice cream with sprinkles you just bought, with a whole new level of joy.
Nevermind, that for the first time in your life you own a phat marker,
and you started tagging the toilets with your incredible and edgy wit.
You&apos;ll get it under control,
I know you will.
There is just a couple of little problems that we do need to talk about...
(and this does not apply to all, just a couple of my readers)
Firstly, stop answering kind greetings &quot;Oh, hey, how are you?&quot; with,
&quot;Still Here&quot; - honestly, we know, we&apos;ve noticed, we just want to known how you are doing this?
And then telling people that you are, or used to be, or whatever: a Firefighter - must stop,
honestly, most people already assumed - that you used you volunteer - to put out hot fires.
Your multiple fanny packs, that&apos;s on point, everybody knows that all the great superheroes,
from Dwayne The Rock Goddamn Johnson to Tomb Raider and Freaky Batman, root and toot for you.
Now, this poem would be incomplete if I didn&apos;t ask you to get up right now,
and stretch a leg or two, a bit, and lookup Nurnberg Trailhead at W Nurnberg Rd, Free Soil, MI 49411.
Or any other tiny Wilderness that&apos;s not too near, not too far,
and spend the afternoon picking out a backpack, a fancy little tent...
The fluffiest sleeping bag you can find,
and one of those fancy inflatable pillows that will make you pass right out.
Grab a box of matches, the biggest, baddest Overkill Rambo knife you can find,
a water bottle, peanut butter wonder bread, a confusing compass and a load of sausages.
And go, don&apos;t delay, if the northern hemisphere is cold,
head on south, if south is cranky, head on north.
You are not supposed live to work,
you are only supposed to work just enough, to live so that you can Read and Listen to Books, and Grow.
Every day is the first day of the rest of your life,
and young or old, every day is a beautiful gift.
And there is no such thing as old age,
that&apos;s just a boogie man that the cowards made up
(If they can&apos;t become a great adventurer, why should anybody else)
Old age is a privilege, denied to many.
People that care about you want you to be Healthy, and Mighty,
they want you to be an Inspiration, that will forever inspire them to, Greatness.
Do not let a day go by...
And gol dang it, you&apos;re a Warrior.
Get two Rambo knives, the one on the left for sausages.
The one on the right, for throwing...
and for chopping Wood, and Moose, and Beaver
- that are so foolish as to wonder into your beautiful campsite.
Eat them,
or Curse Them!
But whatever you do,
get moving right now.
Due north, due south,
whichever is more welcoming.
Go.
Gooooolly, Go.

                      <span class="text-muted">Schools and Teachers, Universities, Colleges, and Professors, and even Politicians,
all had an amazing opportunity to enable the current generations with Real Education.
They will keep saying that they are working on it, and that they love students,
but then they will get confused and put politics first, creating that Hollow Feeling again.
You know what, they have ran out of time,
this is a big century for Human Kind.
We started out on the wrong foot,
we doubled the total of fossil fuel emissions in the last 25 years.
When Al Gore was working on his book,
he was writing in a world that had half the atmospheric emission we do.
You see, we are the leaders now, the intellectuals, the poets, the artists,
the people who failed to stop that doubling have retired or passed away.
If we were to ask them what they did it,
they could only say &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;
No blame, no accountability,
the change is so slow that the men who were destroying the world are gone.
The next 80 years is really important,
we can&apos;t afford to test if perhaps fake education will work out for us if we cram.
It maybe time, to temporarily push away from the promise of a diploma and a job,
and catch up with what has been going on in the world.
Reading and listening to real books is important,
taking responsibility for our own education, is very important.
You get to pick your Audio Books, your own Lecture Videos,
watch Documentaries about Climate and Nature, maybe Politics.
Keep a journal, do a book review,
for every Audio Book and Documentary you like.
And get out there, go camping, and adventuring.
Maybe even section hike the Appalachian Trail, or the Pacific Crest Trail,
or El Camino de Santiago and Kom-Emine, with your friends and parents.
Let the sunrise tell you when it is time to study,
let the sunset help you to sleep.
A lot that was lost in translation during standardized education,
can be pretty quickly regained, with top non-fiction, as long as you make room for it.
So, let us consider taking a year off when we feel ready for books,
maybe before college, or before we transfer to a university.
The journal and corresponding hiking videos or book reviews,
will provide plenty of evidence that it was not a year that was merely lost.
It seems that our Elder Selves will not hold falling in love with books against us,
to the contrary, this maybe one of those things that they wish for.

                      <span class="text-muted">Humanity is like a Garden,
and Humans are flowers that grow with Knowledge.
No one flower can make the other grow,
but we can share and pass on good ideas amongst each other.
All those good ideas combined,
form our body of Knowledge.
Only with real knowledge,
can we bloom in Wisdom.
A Blooming Garden,
is a Higher Power.
To help Humanity grow,
free and mandatory education was invented.
Our level of knowledge rose,
and it rose high enough for us to want more.
The original schools in their zeal to process everyone,
are attempting to confine the garden withing its small walls.
The schools are a simple and dumb machine,
aim to produce the same bunch of flowers.
New, smart technology, has emerged,
and we are now able to Listen to Books and Pick our own Lectures.
And we must do so,
and as quickly as possible.
Let us then choose a small and interesting adventure,
and in the perfect sequence, and at just the right pace.
Begin our study of what we like,
and not what somebody else wants us to like.
The flowers need Real Knowledge to Bloom,
and real knowledge can only be gained and sustained by what we enjoy.
Each flower leans towards a unique constellation of starts,
there is nothing that can be standardized about Real Education.
Standardized Education can only destroy spirit and creativity,
exhaust us, spark by irreplaceable spark, and without ever lighting the flame.
As soon as you feel that school is holding you back,
read your own books, watch your own documentaries and lectures.
Real education, is your own education,
one that you will care for and nurture with passion and joy throughout your entire existence.
Personal Note,
It may feel silly at first,
when you finally take your first baby steps towards something you like.
But that is just a beginning,
they are always very little.
The beautiful thing about it,
is that your first step, will be quickly followed by your second one.
For example,
You may take to watercolors,
and it will all come out a crooked doodle.
But that does not mean that it is over,
or that you are not a genius.
It means you need to buy,
a $100 Video Projector.
Take a selfie,
project it on your watercolor paper.
Use a pencil to mark where colors go,
and now you can paint anew.
Oh, and by the way, to lower color saturation,
mix it with the color opposite, on the color wheel.
Now armed with those two baby steps,
ask your heart, where to go next?
Posters, Murals, Pixel Art,
and if you are unsure, then take a break...
and design and write a small art book about finding a good projector,
and selecting just the right paints, so that you may deeply reflect n what moves you.
Everything comes with a sweet and beautiful little road like this,
we are all human, and what we achieve, we achieve with our hearts.
One of the reasons why many of the wonders that we admire today, exist,
is because someone found a pleasant path to get there a baby step at a time.
Now it might have taken them ten years of baby steps to get there,
but since it was what they loved, they didn&apos;t even think of it as a challenge.
When we follow the path that enriches us,
high achievement becomes indistinguishable from growing up.
Later on in life,
as we face new challenges.
It will be our sweet little pursuits and lessons,
that will offer us the answers we need.
And do so by subtle and beautiful analogy,
to the little problems that we solved in our happy pursuits of yesteryear.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Myths were invented to describe amazing people,
and I&apos;ve seen many amazing creatures in my journeys.
One time out in Nordhouse,
out of nowhere popped out a freshly graduated engineer.
He held up a gallon water container that was carrying back to camp,
and the poor mad lad uttered, &quot;8.34 pounds&quot;.
He seemed excited, but also sad,
and I think he was acting so odd because he realized he was forgetting everything.
Plus, I am certain he said pounds,
not kilograms; mad in deed.
Another time, at 6am or so, I was going through maps of south Pacific,
in Ann Arbor, by that strange black metal cube sculpture that squeaks when rotated.
I just had to get away from Ambrosia&apos;s morning clientele,
bless their hearts.
And I&apos;ve noticed that across the park some student was sleeping under an evergreen,
I don&apos;t think she worked in US, I just somehow assumed South America, Amazon.
She stared getting off the ground, and tried to yell that she wasn&apos;t homeless or drunk,
I kept looking into my maps, ignoring her; and she went on her way to get a grant, or give a speech or something.
I am sure she worked in South America,
probably with the natives.
Over in Ludington, there was this one time a little girl was feeding Seagulls with her mom,
and just as I noticed the commotion...
one of the Seagulls,
went, all, out!
Right in her hair,
I felt so bad, and her mother was only barely able to contain her laughter.
She puffed up her face as if playing a trumpet,
you could totally tell she had enough of that kid, and she was getting payback for all her hissy fits.
And then there is this... story that is most Dearest to me,
one of my happiest memories, that I swore I would never talk about because I am far too mature.
Alas, this is what All Hallows&apos; Eve is all about,
talking about strange creatures, and wonderful memories.
It was an beautiful early morning,
I was sitting by my breakfast fire.
Mostly listening to birds, and probably angry bears,
whilst squiggling in my journal, about poems, and programs.
This was a large and beautiful camp site full of tress,
they had clean showers, and proper restrooms.
I had the first camp site on the Orchid Loop,
and I noticed that a couple of giggly middle aged ladies were just getting into the spirit of camping.
They were always happy, and sophisticated,
and laughing, playing some smart radio station, and always full of joy.
This morning the tall one started shimmy shammying first,
she was probably getting around to starting up a fire to make breakfast.
They had all the firewood,
and swe was singing something, it was unusual for people to make so many happy little noises during a stay there.
She quieted down a bit,
and lit her fire.
And as she bent over to pick up some twigs to get things going,
she fired off that old familiar sound that one would expect from a constipated and uncultured, filthy, lactose intolerant old man.
And, oh my gosh,
all of a sudden all the birds went quiet.
It was just this unusual deafening silence,
and that&apos;s just half the story, because all of a sudden this sophisticated wealthy woman goes:
&quot;Puull my finga&quot;
In the worst fake southern accent she could possibly conjure up,
and with the longest drawl.
And then she quickly skedaddled back to her camper,
- probably to change, and lay down a bit.
This must have been ten years ago or more,
and I still haven&apos;t forgotten about it.
Happy Halloween,
Everyone.

in the sand, they lay bare.
For a few days,
I, manned that blaze.
I lit a fire so great,
that it moved me, to create.
I didn&apos;t have much in my tent,
in my wallet, I didn&apos;t have a singe cent.
I lived in a castle, built by a gigantic dune,
its halls hummed that ancient tune.
In the day I&apos;d gather firewood,
come the eve I&apos;d have a potato, that tasted so good.
I neither searched for a beginning nor the end,
I merely wanted to find idea&apos;s edge, to my own content.
It was right there,
but it was not in the horizon, nor the fire&apos;s flare.
It was in living at a proper pace,
and sleeping in the right place.
The pace at which you live your days,
must match your interest, and remain, in phase.
Composing Music and Painting Art,
are unique and worlds apart.
In art we race to paint,
but in music we must practice restraint.
The eye can&apos;t see,
what the ear can hear.
Though both require layers to become thick,
paintings rain, while music goes tick by tick.
Each requires a different place,
and a walk about at a distinct pace.
There are many out there that move all wrong,
sadly, they will never finish their painting, or their song.
And when it was time go back whence I came,
I rolled up my tent, and put out the flame.
Somebody else down the trail, instantly lit another fire,
and pondered their own wisdom, to their own desire.
I waddled back, my painted walking stick in hand,
slowly marking notes, beats, and measures in the sand.
Now, whenever I try to learn something new,
I wait for time to give me a clue.</span>

                    <span class="text-muted">Invent everything,
we are all extremely smart.
We can learn anything,
so as long as we don&apos;t skip any steps along the way.
And so as long,
as all steps are interesting and fun to us.
Never force yourself to learn something you don&apos;t enjoy,
just keep reading books, and keep looking for something to strike your fancy.
From Dreaming, and Inventing,
to Art, Programming and taking to the skies.
An invention can be as simple,
as an LED Throwie or LED Glowie.
Just a Light Emitting Diode, a battery and magnet,
to keep it all together; and as a bonus make it stick to metal surfaces.
That is a three component invention,
LED, magnet, battery.
My favorite Radio Astronomer,
Seth Shostak.
Quips, that the baseline for determining if a member of a species is intelligent,
is whether or not it can hold a soldering iron, and make a radio.
Allow me to get you soldering a radio,
as quickly as possible.
Get a Raspberry PI Zero W (the W stands for Wireless or &quot;with WI-FI&quot;),
a soldering kit, a solder wick, some GPIO headers,
and a 4 x 8 RGB LED HAT that fits a Raspberry PI Zero neatly.
Look everything up on YouTube,
how to solder, how to solder headers, how to use a solder wick.
This is serious business,
in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.
Though get a $30 kit
that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.
At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,
and set it up on the network.
But later as you figure everything out,
you unplug everything leaving just the power.
To get inside it,
you use a remote terminal.
Once you login,
you get a command prompt.
It listens to words, to commands,
very similar to adventure games.
Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,
are very much like rooms in a game.
To get inside Documents,
type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;
The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,
Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.
When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,
you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.
The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,
just a couple of words and nothing more.
But sometimes, that is not enough,
like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.
We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,
we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.
You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,
it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.
To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,
which is short for list, or list files.
&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,
you can ask it for help like above.
But also ask it to list files in a long format,
by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,
the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.
To list files with readable file sizes,
you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;
Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,
the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,
you just use the short versions.
The command line interface is trying to be your friend,
it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.
There are many tutorials on how to use the command line,
and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference
Here are instructions on how to play audio through HDMI,
your monitor should have an audio out somewhere.
Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,
and try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights based on this tutorial.
Alternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on this instructable,
note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.
And there is also a Raspberry PI WH,
meaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.
And now, get a $10 camera,
and use raspistill to take a photo,
and play around with all the other options.
Now you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,
a programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.
You can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,
you can get an LCD screen and turn it into a tablet.
Raspberry PI is not the only Single-board computer,
PINE looks really nice as well.
If you are looking for a more complicated project,
perhaps try building a Raspberry PI Drone,
bonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.
We have no limits,
but we are also very unique.
Our inventions need not rely on commuters,
some of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.
Don&apos;t let anybody stop you from inventing,
and don&apos;t stop dreaming.
Finally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,
make for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.
Aim,
for the Moon.
