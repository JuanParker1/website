                  <span class="text-muted">Here our Heroines discovered that Social Networks could be used as Human Intelligence based Computer,
and that all it required to build entire governments was the concept of nested groups, (mathematically speaking graphs of sets to which users belong to).
Their research revealed that in 1960&apos;s Detroit, Michigan
was one of the largest Model Cities.
And yet again, that old foe of corruption has emerged,
Model Cities were destroyed by &quot;complicated bureaucracy, inadequate funding, and competing agendas at the local level&quot;.
However, the girls have already worked out,
most of the Anti-Corruption measures.
There will be no such thing as a brand,
or guild.
There will be schools that help people come together,
but the people who satisfy tasks will have their school path, rating and comments to serve as their license.
New comes to a field, such as landscaping,
will charge less until they gain high star rating.
If a large group does grow, it will become divided in two or four,
and this decision will be voted on, by the local community.
It is of some note, that a Landscaping Professional,
claiming a bounty for taking care of a particular set of Condominiums, for example,
can accept cash directly from those who posted the landscaping bounty.
Cosmopolis does not extract a fee for completion of a task or exchange of funds,
there is no need for a bank, storing sensitive information, or constant security audits.
It is really important to be able to to imagine a visit from a landscaping professional,
as a function of Cosmopolis, as an intelligent computer dispatching a human to solve a problem.
When temporary switching to this view,
Cosmopolis becomes an entity powered by the intelligence of millions of humans beings.
The extremely simple idea of voting within a group,
is all the force behind Cosmopolis, it is its intelligence.
When a medical professional notices that the community he is part of could use a hospital,
he can file a Request for Change, and all the members of the community will vote yes or no,
Matters as complex as building a hospital require tens of thousands of tasks,
ranging from arranging for funds, to increasing tips, bounties and scholarships,
so that come a near future, the hospital can begin training medical students.
In some cases, simple program logic will trigger the call for voting on building a new Hospital,
and then human beings will bring in their Intelligence and Expertise.
This scenario serves as an example of Deus Ex Machina,
an intelligent machine powered by Massively Multiuser Self Assembling Intelligence (MMSAI)

                  <span class="text-muted">Once, late at night,
I was prancing in the moonlight.
Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,
and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.
There was an occasional bark or a howl,
but it didn&apos;t get scary till I heard an owl.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she said,
&quot;I am about to swoop down and peck y&apos;all dead.&quot;
&quot;No, thank you Dear Madam&quot;, I sweetly replied,
as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - I heard,
to which I yelled now at a gallop &quot;I ain&apos;t afraid of no bird.&quot;
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,
squirting urine at every step.
And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,
and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.
I was lucky, and my camp was near,
legend has it that she&apos;s still out there filling the woods with fear.
So if if you&apos;re ever out there, and hear a hoot,
better grab onto your butt, and scoot.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">To learn something you must hunger for it,
to learn something, you must love it.
To learn something, you must enjoy it so much, that you will put it aside,
and learn the stuff beneath it first, to grant yourself a fair chance at mastery.
Every little bit counts,
but only if it comes in a sequence that fits what you have already learned.
If you attempt to learn things out of sequence,
or worse yet, trust someone to teach you,
it won&apos;t work, it never has, it never will, forget it.
And it is not just sequence,
it is also the speed at which you learn, that must be taken under consideration.
Sequence and Pace,
now that is just the barbarian level of learning, meant for warriors.
You, can do better than that,
you certainly should.
When you learn is important,
night owls will learn at a different time of day than others.
It is the environment that matters,
some people can&apos;t learn in a city and will needs trees and mountains.
And, the geographic location matters too, if you love numbers, and calculus calls to you,
visit Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz at Neust&#xE4;dter Kirche in Hanover Germany,
visit Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey in London, England.
And remember, Sciences are learned not by memorizing facts,
but by tracing their development across the ages.
Schools are here to teach us,
but they don&apos;t know how.
What they do know,
is how to fake it,
and make it appear like you are learning.
The motive is simple,
for as long as the school gets funding,
everyone gets to keep their job.
Yes,
it is fraud.
Yes, they are selling your mind for a small paycheck,
the curriculum is impossible to learn from.
Curriculum is stitched out of questions that you will have to pass later on,
so that the school can continue to operate, they just want you to retain most of it,
and they will expect you to cram before that test too.
If you want to become a Doctor, Scientist, Mathematician,
you need to be going to a real school, that will encourage you to learn in optimal ways,
a public school is not the optimal setting for education.
A public school is primary for babysitting,
so that you&apos;re not home alone trying to set your or the sticky bandits hair on fire.
In order for that school to exist,
teachers need to get paid,
so you need to pretend to learn by just memorizing,
and passing tests, your grades help the school continue to operate.
Nobody cares if you are learning,
or memorizing.
To graduate with a good GPA, you will have to memorize,
and it will be disconnected facts, they will be out of sequence,
they cannot possibly fit what you already know, and you will forget it all.
In return for hoop jumping you will get a diploma,
and will be accepted to college or university if you cram for the SAT and entrance exams.
In college, your education will be slowed down,
it will be called, balanced education, and they will say it with a straight face like a cult member.
The text books will be $300, lectures $500,
and you can apply for Medical School from here, and move on.
It is hinted that Panama Papers are a good example of what is going on,
there is no central organization that encourages corruption,
it is just that everyone is looking for a shortcut.
You can stand up in class,
but everyone jobs are at stake.
You will be accused of disrupting the class,
and you will be suspended.
They will stress you out,
they will make you tired,
they will make you drop out.
Let me just say,
that you are not allowed to stand by when someone is getting hurt.
If the teacher or security are acting creepy,
talk to the principal, explain that the second time it happens, you will call the police.
The teachers, in their haste will give up on the students in the back,
they have fallen behind on material, but now they are being made to feel that they are unintelligent,
this will destroy their minds, this will cause great harm to their self esteem,
they need your help, get them audio books, Bill Bryson and Carl Sagan.
I think most teachers, when pressured,
will tell you that you are expected to learn on your own,
and in effect confess, that they are useless, when it comes to teaching you for real.
That the classroom is about standardized testing,
for which it is easier to force you to memorize disconnected bits of knowledge that you will soon forget,
then to actually craft a curriculum that will fit all the students,
and match their existing knowledge,
and the natural pace at which they learn,
and their personality.
It used to be true that a single teacher cannot approach all their students in a way that will help them learn,
so to stay in business, they would force them into memorization.
But today, that is not the case. Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,
is because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.
Today, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,
interactive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,
it is possible to approach each student individually,
I am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.
There is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,
that is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.
Even now, I can&apos;t see everything that has gone wrong,
schools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.
But even so, the fact remains,
today schools can&apos;t teach.
They are wicked good,
at tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.
At the end of the day,
you will still need an education.
Your only safe bet,
is becoming self taught,
independent study.
And please, don&apos;t let anybody call you a Genius,
help others, help them find knowledge too.
Finally,
I describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,
on a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.
But, I do know one thing for certain,
this is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.
This is a call for heroism,
for courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.
This is how Life asks for help,
you are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.
Become a Great Being,
Fix Schools.

                  <span class="text-muted">I am sorry my Friends,
but life is not to be lived quietly.
If you are not shaking, and you voice is not broken, from screaming an yelling at the Congress,
when they called you in for questioning - but they had to drag you out,
for screaming - about the disgrace of insider trading, and corruption.
Because you couldn&apos;t keep yourself from being a bright dying star,
out of the potential they held to inspire and move, and educate generations.
If you aren&apos;t standing at the Diag, making the moron that was just there shaking with anger,
because you took his microphone, and you started quoting Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Dennett, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali,
Because it is just enough of evil for that particular day,
and you would, save the sunset by bringing in the Saints.
And if you never painted you car pink, especially the interior, because the Pepto Bismol didn&apos;t work,
and you had nowhere to go and noting to eat, but forward and a bag of stale old chips.
Because you couldn&apos;t put the books down,
for all the Love and Wisdom in there.
Why Henry went into the woods at Walden,
and what happened to Gregor Samsa in Metamorphosis,
and how beautifully Will Durant opened his Story to Philosophy,
&quot;Grow strong, my comrade &#x2026; that you may stand
Unshaken when I fall; that I may know
The shattered fragments of my song will come
At last to finer melody in you;
That I may tell my heart that you begin
Where passing I leave off, and fathom more.&quot;
My Friends,
we are not to live quiet little lives,
because we only get one each.
And the way to turn the volume up,
is to inherit wisdom from all the great beings,
at all cost at any cost,
because without their light we can&apos;t tell where we are going.
Get you audio books ready,
and listen, just learn,
listen to all those lives.
All those great beings,
are sharing lifetimes of wisdom with you.
Endure.
Listen.
Teach.
Move Mountains.
Make History.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">By the time you realize how true it is that the world is yours,
all the authority figures you once knew, will have retired.
So in teenage days, just as teachers are brainlessly trying to convince everyone,
that we are not good enough because we don&apos;t listen, or because we are failing their questionable curriculum.
We actually need to take a step back,
and find a way to learn for real.
Because even if, we don&apos;t waste, a single day,
real life will do a pretty good job at overwhelming us anyway.
You need to be learning hard,
with your friends.
You need to be learning,
from Lectures, Documentaries, Audio Books, Maker Shops and Hacker Spaces.
You need to be learning how to build real businesses,
that have a long lasting impact on your community, and maybe the world.
For those of us who aren&apos;t going into cozy Science or Medicine,
we need to come out of High School fists up, fighting, and swinging and kicking.
Because it is not college that should follow High School,
college is something you do for entertainment.
Taking late classes to unwind,
and sharpen your memorization and concept mapping skills.
After High School, you need to put an A-Team together, bitchy parents included,
and cross the Appalachian Trail, and keep in mind, that you may become a regular hiker.
After High School,
your first and only aim, is to find a reasonable path to Greatness.
Do you hear me,
My Friends?
Greatness... because everywhere else,
somehow, unforgivably, may just lead right back to the start.
You just don&apos;t know what it is going to be like when you return,
but you will be part mountain goat, part wild person that comfortably sh*ts in the woods.
And what is more, my friends, you will know, that should life ever challenge you,
you will be able to handle it, with Heart and Soul, with Wisdom, Humor and Grace.
There is not a moment to waste, there is not a day to pass,
make everyone of them count, and then help others to their own paths.
Remind your younger generation,
that they are not to lead sleepy lives of mild discontent.
You are the future, you are wisdom that the world needs to survive,
you are the leaders that are all the Hopes and Dreams of the past generations,
and your rightful stance in life, is that of a Great Being, and nothing less.
