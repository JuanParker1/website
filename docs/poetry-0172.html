          <p>You are not alone,<br>
            and all you do matters.</p>
          <p>As you rise,<br>
            you create a way for others to follow.</p>
          <p>Struggle, like suffering,<br>
            is a gas that fills all the available space.</p>
          <p>It is never easy for anybody,<br>
            the difference is in the choices we make and the aims we set.</p>
          <p>The first Great Choice is to set off towards wisdom,<br>
            to continuously transcend our limits thorough out our entire existence.</p>
          <p>One of the finest choices we can make,<br>
            is to Live Above Common Levels of Life.</p>
          <p>There are no guarantees,<br>
            your choice to proceed forward is all the guarantee there is.</p>
          <p>Our biological life is not finely crafted,<br>
            it is a result of fundamental principles of Physics and Chemistry.</p>
          <p>But our mind, is up to us to shape,<br>
            hence Audio Books and Lectures and our inheritance from of Other Lives, Times, and Works.</p>
          <p>You need not hurry,<br>
            but you do need to slow down so that you may read and write.</p><br>
          <p>We each have a story to tell,<br>
            and many will follow a similar path to ours across the vastness of future.</p>
          <p>They could use some advice,<br>
            a few fine words about rising, about what it is like to see the sun for the first time.</p>
          <p>Do not let your readers suffer the same loneliness you did,<br>
            let them learn from you.</p><br>
          <p>And the way you write,<br>
            is one thought at a time.</p>
          <p>So as long as your write about your unlimited travels,<br>
            you never run out of the story to tell.</p>
          <p>And every once in a while,<br>
            a poem will leap ahead of you.</p>
          <p>The thought will arrive,<br>
            from the future before you get there.</p>
          <p>You are connected to your future self,<br>
            no one can hold a stronger bond.</p>
          <p>You are a being, with a mind and body, you are in the present,<br>
            but you exist across time.</p>
          <p>Your Life Line, your Life Time,<br>
            The past you and the future you, are connected.</p>
          <p>And just the same those who came before you,<br>
            and those who are yet to follow, are connected to you.</p>
          <p>But you have to write your thoughts,<br>
            ...when you are rising in your childhood,<br>
            the children can understand it best.</p>
          <p>In your early age, as you make your way,<br>
            as you learn to rise, and find your rhythm,<br>
            your readers will be in their twenties.</p>
          <p>And then, forties, and then sixties, and eighties, and hundreds,<br>
            at no point in your life should you be ashamed to write,<br>
            or be shamed for writing.</p><br>
          <p>Because if you can manage to hold your pen,<br>
            it is more than most others can.</p>
          <p>One thought at a time,<br>
            help others understand how to climb.</p>
          <p>Make all your struggles count for more,<br>
            show them how you fought for wisdom in your war.</p>
          <p>Tell the world what you know,<br>
            so that others may safely follow.</p>
          <p>Know that the first struggles sometimes mean more,<br>
            sometimes the hardest challenge is to get off the floor.</p>
          <p>The first steps after all,<br>
            matter the most to those whose worlds may be seem small.</p>
          <p>All steps matter and in many ways,<br>
            all lead to enlightenment, and the Sun&apos;s rays.</p>
