                      only the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to teach,
                      and not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend, had. not.

                      an infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting contributions
                      are necessary.</p>

                      <p>I hope we will commit ourselves to building a human rights movement to end
                        mass incarceration. A movement for education, not incarceration. A movement
                        for jobs, not jails, and a movement to end all those forms of legal
                        discrimination against people released from prison. Discrimination denying
                        them basic human rights to work, to shelter, and to food.</p>

                    <p>It is heartbreaking that videos like &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Talk to the Police&#x201D; must exist.
                      A Police Officer must also be a Hero, a force of Goodness. Any compromise
                      between good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil.</p>

                    <p>December 10th, is <a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/">The Human Rights Day</a> and yet again, the hopelessness
                      turns to hope as we are granted a globally recognized focal point, and an
                      opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
                    <p>When this nation is ready, December 10th will become the walkout day. For
                      District Judges, their staff, Attorneys, their assistants, for Bad Cops,
                      Good Police Officers, and their COs. On their mind will be the thought,
                      that to create a life long, legal, discrimination against an individual, is
                      a Human Rights violation. It should be impossible to ask the legal
                      community to follow the rule of law in the short term, and violate Human
                      Rights in the long run.</p>

                      <h2>Poverty of Mind</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Poverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that
                      opposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.
                      Can we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would likely
                      not commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty? Every child
                      has a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons, Astrophysics -
                      goodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astrobiology. But poverty is
                      extremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in it self, but in
                      the surrounding culture that it frequently creates. Poverty is a virus
                      armed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia, violence, and dark
                      blind stupidity.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Some years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander
                      put us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many
                      more things right.</p>
                    <p>In great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise your
                      children, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the
                      wall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up
                      high enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,
                      is not optional.</p>
                    <p>My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is
                      null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal
                      Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and
                      void. We are one family, one people.</p>
                    <p>I ask you to build homes with the belief that <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html">the inherent dignity and
                        equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the
                        foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world</a>, because
                      our humanity depends on everyone&#x2019;s humanity.</p>

                    <p>By rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes,
                      of great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world
                      forever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.</p>
                    <p>The job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the
                      way up.</p>
                    <p>All the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one
                      place where we can each share in them, where every member of the human
                      family can Converge on Wisdom.</p>

How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few.

What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>

Your teachers will fight you, because they just want to do their job, go home, and get paid. If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job and go watch some TV. You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&apos;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot; and you&apos;ll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you&apos;ll struggle to remember where it all started and what the battle was for. Because The Battle Is Not For You: The battle is for those that come; after you. In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the same. In long term, you help the world grow, it won&apos;t be your world, it will be the world of the future. The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education are two separate things. It will make you tired. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood. Bad News: There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too low. Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education, the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot; grades, making your parents happy. Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never looking back. Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue. Henry David Thoreau: I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms... The Good News: Real Education, is not about getting really educated. It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health. Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is not a healthy life. Faith of the Heart Article One: Inherent Dignity, Nobility.: The first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility. No one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or vacation, or else. You are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you are to rage, to rage against the dying of the light.
