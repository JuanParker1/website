there is something you should know.
Put on your mittens, and a hat,
and buy a big bottle of suntan lotion right where you&apos;re at.
But don&apos;t drive back home, just turn south on 275,
and drive.
We&apos;re going all the way down,
to take care of your frown.
You&apos;ll drive through Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
right till you get to good old Georgia.
Here you stop, and some sleep.
but wake up early, cause we got a pace to keep.
Drive all the way through Florida to US Highway One,
and be ready to catch some sun.
Get to Little Duck Key,
and park beneath a palm tree.
Now, squirt some suntan lotion.
and enjoy the Ocean.

                  <span class="text-muted">Our cognitive biases,
will only keep causing trouble for as long as we are unaware of them.
Eventually, new, fully functional educational systems,
will help us to Knowledge and Wisdom.
As we learn to trust computers,
we will learn to stop relying on easily corruptible career politicians.
The educated voter democracies of the future,
will stand as powerful machines helping us manage our cities and Earth with the wisdom of the crowds.
The world before us lost 99% of its species,
the climate is ever changing.
The layer of oxygen we all rely on is extraordinary thin,
and most of earth is Ocean and the rest requires that we protect ourselves from elements.
While we are bound to this planet chemically,
Earth never really relied on us for anything.
We are not the destroyers, not is Earth,
we are simply yet to be fully awakened caretakers and maintainers.
We need a more powerful educational system,
one that reaches deep into all corners of Humanity,
From Yawanawa, Romani, Maasai, Samoyeds, Rotumans, and Hawaiians,
we all have to come together now as a single family.
What must connect us, is education,
which is just a path to Knowledge and Wisdom.
Whoever we are, and whatever we think we are doing,
we are made much better by inheritance of Knowledge and Wisdom,
which in turn begets Compassion, and Empathy, and the very cure for our Cognitive Biases.
The Love of The Human Family,
and the Insight and Understanding it entails.
It is OK to have made mistakes,
it is just our cognitive biases,
and lack of education, and poverty, and fear.
But it is not OK to stay within the confines of those mistakes,
Earth needs our help, the animals need our help too,
and we can&apos;t help them without Education and the Unity it entails.
All it will take is Storytellers and Lovers of Science and Knowledge,
and Narrators, reading it all in the many languages.
May this century,
become The Century Of The School.
A tiny Audio Player, perhaps a solar powered School on a Chip,
or free access satellites that truly bring the internet to all.
We don&apos;t have to Love All Humanity at first,
just the Tigers, the Big Pussy Cats, 3,890 left,
let us come together now, let us help Earth and all of her inhabitants.
And where education leads,
the nations will follow.

We learn a new language out there,
the edge grants us a new vocabulary.
A vocabulary, is also an aid for thinking,
it helps us navigate better.
And the edge is a sacred place,
there you can quietly comprehend what all Great Beings speak of.
And, it becomes your anchor,
the thing that makes sense.
it becomes the point from which you measure other things,
as you progress forward.
And, Look who else is here,
the Elder You.
They all come here, at every plateau, in each great loneliness,
ask them what their regrets are, and prevent them all from occurring.
The edge is a sacred place,
you are always safe out here, you are always welcome, and you are never alone.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">It is not &quot;the secret to happiness&quot;,
it is that happiness; is the secret.
Happiness is the true human superpower.
Sure, we can push through anything,
and adapt to everything.
But, in happiness,
our might multiples to no end.
And happiness can&apos;t be faked,
happiness depends on authenticity.
I think it is the key to learning,
adventuring, exploring, and discovering.
It is the key to invention, to creativity,
to becoming a force of nature.
Happiness puts us up,
on the highest of levels of existence.
Right up there with distant supernoveae,
quasars, neutron stars, and stellar nurseries.
On par with the Universe,
contributing something the quarks and quasars can&apos;t.
I am certain, we only have one flaw,
just a small stupid mistake
One that that can be easily avoided,
so as long as we remind each other about it.
We accept what we are born into as a standard,
and along with it we accepts the false leaders as well.
If the culture and its leaders are headed for a black hole,
we have an overwhelming tendency to blindly follow.
We have to grab each other, with Art, Music, Poetry,
with Doodles and Graffiti, Hugging, Shouting, and Howling.
Grab each other by the ears and whisper,
whilst gently rocking the head in every direction.
&quot;Do not go gentle into that good night,
rage, rage, against the dying of light.&quot;
And when we snap out of that gravitational pull,
we must begin our journey up, all the way up.
Nobody knows,
what comes first.
Healing, Leadership.
Love of Live, Joy of Being,
Love, Happiness, Wisdom,
Greatness, Enlightenment.
Authenticity, Dignity, Nobility,
Courage, Valor, Honor, Heroism.
Adventure, Content of Character, Strength and Unbreakability,
Fortitude, Foresight, Understanding, Insight.
Creativity, Invention,
Dance and Rebellion.
I suppose no one knows which comes first because it all comes at once,
all of those marvels are one, indivisible, part of Being Human.
We must avoid what Dear Sir Ken Robinson refereed to as,
Taking Things for Granted.
We must avoid assuming that something is true,
without thinking about it, without questioning it.
We must resist self-indoctrination into cultures,
that we are merely born into.
Only when we break away from that dark thoughtless path,
will we be able to freely grow and rise up.
Only on our way up,
will we find Happiness, and the other Marvels.
And although this century will be a challenging one,
when we face it upright.
Enabled by the marvels that makes us Human, and on par with the universe,
we will rise, and learn, and become wiser for it.
We have lost ten tigers, in recent weeks,
we are down to 3890 tigers.
The Tragedy of the Big Pussy Cats,
is one way, that the universe is helping us rise.
Remember, first you must learn to resist indoctrination,
resist taking things for granted, resist following leaders you don&apos;t know,
resist the fallacy of choosing the lesser evil.
And second, you must take to books,
self educate by falling in love with Humanity&apos;s most celebrated works.
With each step upwards towards becoming a great being,
you will gain more and more abilities.
And third, Educated Humanity,
is a United Humanity.
To repeat one of the quotes by Robert Ardrey that Sir Ken Robinson was fond of,
&quot;...We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels,
The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk
but how magnificently he has risen.
We are known among the stars by our poems...&quot;</span>

what I am about to say.
Yes,
it is all connected.
You can learn the Melbourne Shuffle nearly instantly,
if you start with Alan Walker&apos;s Faded.
There is a springy sound in between the beat past the intro,
that&apos;s where you contract your core, that&apos;s the middle step,
that divides mere shuffling feet; from actual Melbourne Shuffle.
The only other thing you have to remember,
is that the leg you lift goes forward, and then you switch legs.
The sound controls your body,
start with a slower song or a different genre and it will be a lot harder,
for a person who is just starting, it may be too hard to try to dance to a different song.
And music is basically a program,
it is just Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies assembled into a song.
You can easily break down Drums, Bass, Chords, and Melodies into their structure,
you can hear it in your ear, you can write it down on paper, in color, with squiggles and emphasis.
But there is a better way, even better than LMMS,
and that is programming.
A song you program can play forever,
and the programming language that you learn along the way, is actually a method for interfacing with technology,
The GUI is a very slow method of controlling computers,
the command line, automation of the command line, and writing commands you can use and automate,
is the first, and really the only way to get computers to work for us, not against us.
And on the other spectrum, you can write a program,
that will control your dance, the very way you move.
It is all connected, Sam Aaron is correct in his analogy,
we don&apos;t learn to write to become book authors, we just need it,
and we don&apos;t learn programming to sit in an office cubicle all day long,
We do it to save day,
to save some time,
and to dance that time away.
