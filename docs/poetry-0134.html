                  <span class="text-muted">I had a strange dream, Dear Reader, and at first I thought it was too odd to share,
but now I am thinking, maybe someone you will care.
I dreamt that schools were totally, completely fake,
and that the future of the whole world was at stake.
They became fake because they never could teach,
no teacher has ever had that kind of reach.
Eventually it just became all make believe,
and school became a real thief.
It stole Knowledge from you,
it did it to get teachers paid through.
Most assumed, you wouldn&apos;t notice as it kept all blind,
but that early Knowledge was important for the shaping the mind.
There was no one in charge, so no whistle was blown,
it was fake it until you make it, each on their own.
They wrote tests to keep scores within range,
to stay below all radars, and to resist any improvement or change.
Expensive text books, purely artificial grades,
cheap college and expensive university to encourage transfers and trades.
The students who did well,
they had to keep quiet to pass, and anyway, there was no one to tell.
They had to work thrice as hard working with tutors and in groups,
jumping stupid hoops, making pointless and crazy loops.
And they knew that their success made schools look real and true,
but they had no choice, they had to, graduate and move on through.
Then you got up and said &quot;I am through!,
&quot;how do we fix this - what do we do?&quot;
That&apos;s when I woke up, and thought - &quot;Maybe I should answer this.&quot;,
and the first thought that came to my mind was &quot;Knowledge is Bliss&quot;
So I said out loud: &quot;Real Education must be your own creation!&quot;,
after all, is not too hard to find moving inspiration so that you can build your own education.
And why do we need a small High School lecture,
perhaps it is time to change that architecture.
We should listen to a Famous Audio Books or the University Edition,
perhaps that should become the standard position.
Standardized testing should not lead the way,
it is just a test to see if we learning OK.
It seem to me that time has come for change,
perhaps this is why schools feel so strange.
So, I challenge you, my Dear Reader,
lead the change you hope to see, become the leader!</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Grab onto your butts,
we are about to go nuts!
We are headed back in time,
to make a little bit of rhyme.
Do you want to know,
where and when we are going?
Greece! 425 BC,
to see about a real teacher, having a walk with his students by the sea.
Everyone else was stuck in their own life,
and Socrates too in his own way, was contemplating strife...
But he made a big breakthrough,
as he understood, how he grew.
It was all the lessons he was adding together,
while! ignoring all that did not matter.
&quot;Oh wow&quot; - he finally proclaimed - &quot;I really do know how I grew&quot;,
then turned to his students and said, &quot;and so should you!&quot;
He told them, that when people are stuck,
they only run in circles, and out of luck.
We must learn to study what is wise,
but also, ignore the less important so that we have a chance to rise.
And then once we become smart,
we can go all the way back, if we wish,
and begin super-smart at start.
OK, we must now return back to our time,
as we now have a whole poem full of rhyme.
So, the lesson for this evening is this:
Life is not a confusing mess or some dark abyss,
it is meant be lived in wisdom, with foresight and in pure bliss.
But to get there we must both; learn what to ignore,
and figure out what&apos;s important so we can stay on that sunny shore.
And we really, really, really need to ask this question,
this is not some strange rhyming suggestion.
What is real, what is fake?
what is merely keeping you busy - your whole life is at stake!
Are you learning in school, becoming wiser every day?
Or are they forcing your with grades, to merely role play?
Because if your school is fake, merely playing the role of a babysitter,
then they are tricking you our of wisdom, and you should be bitter.
Education is the first big deal in life,
it will help you fix problems before they begin, and keep you out of strife.
If you are not learning, then listen to lectures and audio books,
learn to avoid strife, and stray away from these crooks.
Do not let crappy teachers sell your mind for their pay check with charades,
tell them you want real knowledge not fake grades.
Don&apos;t let anybody trick you into a fake education,
because that never lead to a real graduation.
Visit your elder self, make sure that they remember who they are,
make sure their knowledge is as densely packed as a Neutron Star,
- if not then try to figure out what their regrets are.
You know what?! either way,
start listening to real lectures and powerful audio books, every day.
Authenticity Above All, do it for Socrates, do it for the Elder You,
ignore all the crooks, read your own books.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">No one person can save the world,
we have to take turns because of how exhausting that is.
No one person can speak to the whole world,
the world is too complex and our voice and message will become too scattered.
We just need to keep speaking until the message of leaving bad ideas behind becomes less and less blurry.
Our problem is not so dissimilar
from the problem of a victim of a cult.
Our problem works on the same principle,
limited knowledge, limits our awareness,
limited awareness constricts us to a subset of reality.
A fine example of constricted reality,
are dark or medieval ages.
Five hundred years ago Human Beings were just as intelligent as we are,
they simply knew less, were aware of less.
The culture and popular beliefs were rooted, in less.
Another example is raising a child,
with the genetics of someone from 10,000 years ago; today.
Growing up today would make them, just an average person,
they would not wish to take a bite out of a Woolly Mammoth,
or hope to own a Giant Ground Sloth, not anymore than we do.
They&apos;d appreciate the iPhone, in form of the model they appreciate the most,
and had they been made aware that they are of the Ice Age,
they&apos;d sweetly and jokingly name their kitty cat, Scrat.
Our knowledge and the culture we grow up in, is extremely influential,
it decides how we develop, who we become, and what we recognize as reality.
A child born a couple of hundred years for now,
will struggle to understand our ignorance towards climate change.
In the schools of tomorrow, they will learn that we were victims,
of broken educational systems, and cultures that didn&apos;t encourage pursuit of Wisdom.
To put it simply, some things sneak into us based on the level of our knowledge,
and the height of development of the culture we are born into.
So are we really?
Geniuses.
This is very important, it is a very important single word answer,
to a very important question, that has great impact on the future of humanity.
We are Geniuses.
You know that man that is always wearing old clothes,
and kind of works in a corner, and acts a little odd.
He is also a genius.
He is dying from loneliness, his mind is warped from ages of overwork,
he can&apos;t really connect with people anymore because he has been feeling like an outsider for too many years,
he found comfort in his corner, where he is safe and where his life is simple.
But, should a chain of events push him,
he will shed the patina of isolation, he will force himself to inherit modern culture and lifetimes from books,
and genius will return, it will be fresh, raw, reignited, he may for a moment become the wisest being on earth.
That&apos;s what genius is,
a combination of unbreakability, and intellectual infinity.
In more general terms,
We are a very odd Form of Life compared to all the other animals on Earth,
we are self aware, and we are able to evaluate, and adjust, we are self enabling.
Ayn wrote,
&quot;If a drought strikes them, animals perish - man builds irrigation canals;
if a flood strikes them, animals perish - man builds dams;
if a carnivorous pack attacks them, animals perish - man writes the Constitution of the United States.&quot;
We are struck by a culture that does not fully represent reality,
but we will not jump from the cliff, we will not merely age - business as usual.
We will learn, we will teach ourselves to become genius,
the easy-peasy way, by going on long adventures with a bunch of wise non-fiction books.
When our planet comes under attack, it will not perish,
for it holds a species of animal that can perceive it self, alter, and rise to heights unseen.
All it takes,
is for us to notice, that something is wrong.
Perhaps, taking it easy, would be OK,
if you were not capable, of becoming a Great Being.
if you were not a Genius, and a Powerful Thinker.
If you were unable to rise, to Inspire Generations,
to save the Planet for all the Children yet to be born,
and to repair schools so that they help humanity progress.
But ultimately taking it easy, can&apos;t be OK,
because that would disappoint the one person that truly does have all the authority over you,
that you really do not want to disappoint, in any way.
Your Elder Self...
Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,
if you fail to quickly shed all the stupid things sneaked into you by mis-education and questionable culture.
Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,
if you fail to learn to unfold your wings as a genius, and an intellectual.
Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,
if you fail to rise out of loneliness and isolation.
Your elder self, will be seriously pissed off,
if you mess this up.
Your elder self will know exactly who you could have become,
and where you made the wrong decisions that prevented you from becoming the person that they wish to be.
My Friends,
I wish there was more I could to to help you believe that you are each a genius.
But I can only give you the books.
I can&apos;t put the ear-buds in your ears and press play,
because to hear the books you have to slow down in life,
you have to begin questioning the things that were driving you,
and you have to become ready to listen,
and by that time you can press play on your own.
A genius is not an intellectual anomaly,
even Savants spend years mastering their tricks.
We are all capable of gaining Powerful Intelligence,
and we don&apos;t need schools for that,
just a mountain of down to earth books made heavy with lifetimes of wisdom.
You don&apos;t need to memorize Mathematical Formulas,
and the last place you want to learn about Biology, is Biology.
What you need is stories that teach you about the reasons behind the invention of mathematics,
and and an adventure where you re-invent mathematics from scratch, with the fantastic and magical ability to look some stuff up along the way.
You don&apos;t need to learn about the powerhouse of the cell,
you need to begin with Stromatolites, Panspermia, Evolution and Astrobiology.
Mitochondria used to be a separate organism, what an adventure to follow, what an honor to make new discoveries on that path.
My Friends,
You must begin your education by pushing everything that interferes with your Natural Genius away,
even if it is the city you live in, or school you are forced to go to.
And you must begin your life, knowing that you are a Powerful Genius,
in dire need for more books and audio books that will fuel your Wisdom.
As I write this,
there are only 3,900 tigers left.
Please, believe in your genius, and grow, my friend,
it is not just the tigers that need help,
the task at hand if far greater.
With ten million people in cages around the word,
we have to help children and students of today,
out of poverty, and towards real education,
so that they may have a chance at a fair start in life.</span>

learning slowly in many stages.
I begun in 1999,
and I am still learning new things about design.
All the programming languages changed many times,
but knowing the whole history is very useful at times.
I&apos;ve learned a lot from the command line,
to art, colors, design, and how to reach the finish line.
I am surprised how long it all took,
but with all I know I am sure I could write a whole book.
I still have to learn a bunch of stuff,
but it is not going to be very tough.
I mostly have to get all the colors, and glows to dance and blend,
I kind of left all the fun stuff for the very end.</span>
