                    <p>It started Christmas 2020, the world was already in trouble;</p>
                    <p>the conjecture in a sentence was this:</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&quot;What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere&quot;,</p>
                    <p>it is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is commonly known as corruption, but that didn&apos;t matter to them,</p>
                    <p>because they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And by everything,</p>
                    <p>they meant institutions all around the world.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>They were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot;,</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,</p>
                    <p>they would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Initially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,</p>
                    <p>but there was a way to find out.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,</p>
                    <p>it was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,</p>
                    <p>the bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>So part of the reason why the programming was so simple,</p>
                    <p>is that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>When everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,</p>
                    <p>and some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,</p>
                    <p>then the program could replace all the management software of a real city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,</p>
                    <p>it took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>They knew that they became famous,</p>
                    <p>when the UN wouldn&apos;t stop calling.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,</p>
                    <p>they kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,</p>
                    <p>about 10,000 running copies.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>What was fascinating about this,</p>
                    <p>is that it was still played as a game.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,</p>
                    <p>that everyone went to for internet news.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML</p>
                    <p>and to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>It is a Virtual City at heart,</p>
                    <p>but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,</p>
                    <p>it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,</p>
                    <p>because their voting history is under their profile.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,</p>
                    <p>some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program as a whole,</p>
                    <p>eliminated the need for representatives.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People vote on issues that need immediate attention,</p>
                    <p>and those are the first issues that get solved.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Two amazing things emerged from within the program,</p>
                    <p>schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),</p>
                    <p>and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Schools started working,</p>
                    <p>it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The second,</p>
                    <p>people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,</p>
                    <p>people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,</p>
                    <p>the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,</p>
                    <p>any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,</p>
                    <p>there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,</p>
                    <p>so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,</p>
                    <p>one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>The entire process was often ran by bots,</p>
                    <p>city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,</p>
                    <p>were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,</p>
                    <p>the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,</p>
                    <p>they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,</p>
                    <p>they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>
                      This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,</p>
                    again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication
                    to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.<p></p>

                    <p>The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">The only thing that divides Humanity,
is levels of education.
The more educated we become,
the closer we come together.
With real education,
comes wisdom.
Humanity is destined,
to come together in Wisdom and Peace.
To hasten our Convergence on Wisdom,
we must accept the responsibility for our own education.
We are each perfectly unique,
there is no such thing as a standard human mind.
We must choose our own books the books we enjoy,
and walk the path that fits us best book by book, at just the right pace.
A book is a stored wisdom,
where our body needs food our mind needs books.
Books accelerate our intellectual development,
books are inherited best when read by a fine narrator.
It will take a hundred books to find the ten we need,
and poetically speaking our mind will merge with their wisdom.
We will become wiser, more compassionate,
more authentic, stronger, calmer and more creative.
While looking at ourselves we see the common Humanity,
we are more than that.
When the younger generations look at us,
we are a call to Enlightenment, to Inspiration, and Knowledge and Wisdom.
Who we are,
is where all the world&apos;s children follow.
Let us delay no more,
and take to books right now.
Let us help those who have difficulty reading,
by helping them to narrated versions.
And let us not forget,
that Greatness calls to All Beings.
Therefore, let us all become Wise and Great,
so that the Younger Generations may follow.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Fake schooling and the resulting lack of education,
not only hold us back and propagate misery but will destabilize a nation.
But the problems are far more complicated,
for one there are very few real criminals, most were just warped by lack of school.
Real schools, have the ability,
to prevent a person from committing a crime.
On top of that, upon committing a crime,
if prisons were turned to special need schools, we could help almost everyone.
Real schools are not that complex,
plus they can use poverty to their advantage.
By presenting students with a way out of poverty that fits them,
the students will be put in a position where they will want to learn particular things.
That&apos;s how real education works,
it is not about tests an memorization, but need, imagination, triumph and challenge.
Be it a misguided voter, a desperate student, or someone blinded by fear and anger and poverty,
schools are all there really is, it is the greatest hope and dream.
What we call a school today, is not a school,
it is a collective fantasy that hands the teachers a paycheck, and the students a diploma.
Our cognitive biases make it so that we go along with it,
there are people out there who hold up a diploma they crammed for and truly believe they are an engineer.
This is probably similar to when a person commits a crime,
they say &quot;This is is this is where I finally become free&quot;, but that is only cartoon reality.
A college diploma does not mean that the student is educated,
and when deans are pressed they will say, &quot;We discouraged cramming&quot;.
And when everyone is pressed to own up,
the mother of the boy who stole,
the engineer&apos;s professor,
and the engineer and the student,
and that so called criminal,
the men who approve textbooks,
those who pray to fairy-tales in hopes of saving nations they mistakenly destroyed,
and the prime ministers, and royalty,
popes and cardinals,
and the congresses, and the president,
and the men who nearly destroyed this nation by the practice of &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;,
and those who ignored climate change and might have done a lot worse than torture,
and those who are glad, that we all forgot,
that we have all pointed intercontinental ballistic missiles at each other,
all the major cities, all of them, every family, every future.
All they will say is this:
&quot;I was JUST following orders.&quot;
&quot;I JUST didn&apos;t know.&quot;
&quot;HOW was I supposed to know?&quot;
This is what fake education results in,
this is the &quot;fake it until you make it&quot; pattern of behavior.
The solution to it all is books,
books that those of us who are good at narration,
read for others who aren&apos;t very good at reading.
Teams of students, ganging up together to record books, with laughter, and foolishness,
and dammit, sometimes adding whole new chunks to them, to make the dry parts more interesting.
And sharing, with everyone,
everywhere.
Laughter is the ultimate seal of authenticity,
that something is worth our time.
Once the world awakens to the realization that students should make the lectures,
driving them with collective curiosities and inspirations, and sharing them for free.
Kids will want to watch them,
they will want to see what happens next.
Can you imagine a set of lectures by students working to bring back Pixel Art Games,
lectures on the subject of Color Theory, Trigonometry, Calculus, Music Composition, and even woodworking for the arcade cabinets.
Can you see what having that full vision do to a young mind,
how inspiring it is to see the classroom succeed in turning out, one game after another, and making a pretty penny too.
Real schools combine with reality,
they are both an introduction to the real world and a future extension of it.
I know that all of this is a lot to take in,
it is a description of the biggest of our problems,
and the middle of our solutions.
The beginning is much simpler than that,
the beginning starts off like every superhero origin story ever told.
You build up your power,
you armor.
You pick up your first book, your second book, your third book,
Metamorphosis, Walden, Cosmos, Into The Wild.
Sagan, Bryson, Thoreau, Kafaka, Krakauer, Kant, Nietzche,
Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, and countelss others.
With each book you hear, you inherit you inherit the wisdom of the author,
just like that, straight up data transfer,
and re-listening to the same audio books or lectures makes them even more powerful.
It takes a few years to take it all on,
but before you know it, your own idea synthesis kicks in.
You&apos;ll be able to feel the world,
and feel the fear of the fakers, and pretenders.
You&apos;ll be able to see the paths of change,
that the world needs so that it may continue growing.
You&apos;ll be able to connect, restore, repair, and resume,
the thoughts of all great beings from across all the ages.
Your intelligence is not set in stone, it is flexible,
your mind is there to help you become more and more intelligent.
The more you know, the faster you learn more,
and the wiser and more intelligent you become.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Humanity can only grow by looking into its heart,
and slowly learning Philosophy, Sciences, and Art.
It is easy.
It is what the modern non-fiction is all about,
just, grab an audio book and go all out.
Hey, you don&apos;t need any reasons,
to become a connoisseur of the Seasons!
In Autumn, only read about Mother Nature,
and modern Adventure.
In Winter, focus on Philosophy and Art,
so that come spring you are always chipper and smart.
In Spring, you must absolutely read about Inner Strength,
mostly memoirs just to see how a human can go to great length.
In Summer, read or listen about our History,
how countless great beings fought for Unity, Wisdom and Glory.
The world is worthy of our love,
we should each transcend out limits, high and above.
We must all reach for knowledge and wisdom and awake,
forget leaders we can&apos;t ever know if they are true or fake.
We are one family, one world, one nation,
and the only thing dividing us is lack of education.
It is really hard to see,
how powerful Knowledge and Wisdom can be.
Maybe, think of it as knowledge received,
from lives you have not lived.
Once we all take to wisdom, real education will become first,
then we&apos;ll unite, and take down all the nuclear missiles that have us cursed.
Only then will we know,
how far is humanity able to go.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Wisdom is the substance with which Humanity grows,
and it is also the might with which every hero rose.
There cannot be a united world without a wise voter,
systems of politics can&apos;t work like a motor.
Corruption comes out of most people wanting to appear smart,
but their incompetence does not end when they depart.
Not only are they replaced by more of the same,
but the policies they set continue wandering without an aim.
Systems as such expand until they seize and fall,
then from the ashes can only rise a wall after wall.
It is because pretenders when pressed can only pretend more,
liars can only destroy a nation and lead it to war.
A nation must first help its uneducated, poor, and weak,
because poverty prevents people from learning and makes the future bleak.
Then, to power a system the voter must be educated and wise,
otherwise they can only contribute to the system&apos;s demise.
We cannot hope to build a peaceful nation,
if we do not begin with functional and real education.
Cognitive biases alone,
will corrupt a politician down to the bone.
But their real curse is such,
that they can&apos;t know, that they don&apos;t know very much.
Fake it until you make it, is not a driving force,
it is a mode of being rotten at the source.
Alas, we are too beautiful to allow politicians to sell it all,
we will turn our heads away from their madness and their fall.
A day will come, when they call for their wars,
but we&apos;ll be too busy, tearing down walls, and opening windows, and doors.
The future generations should look towards the internet,
building a world united by a peaceful mindset.
A world build far and above geographic borders,
one that is connected by Education and Compassion, not just orders.
But, we cannot Unite - without Wisdom and Schools,
today we do not yet have the necessary tools.
Non the less, the symbol of the Withe Dove,
will continue waiting for Humanity to unite, in Wisdom and Love.
