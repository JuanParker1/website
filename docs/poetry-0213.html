                    <p>It started Christmas 2020, the world was already in trouble;</p>
                    <p>the conjecture in a sentence was this:</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&quot;What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere&quot;,</p>
                    <p>it is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is commonly known as corruption, but that didn&apos;t matter to them,</p>
                    <p>because they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And by everything,</p>
                    <p>they meant institutions all around the world.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>They were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot;,</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,</p>
                    <p>they would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Initially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,</p>
                    <p>but there was a way to find out.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,</p>
                    <p>it was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,</p>
                    <p>the bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>So part of the reason why the programming was so simple,</p>
                    <p>is that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>When everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,</p>
                    <p>and some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,</p>
                    <p>then the program could replace all the management software of a real city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,</p>
                    <p>it took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>They knew that they became famous,</p>
                    <p>when the UN wouldn&apos;t stop calling.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,</p>
                    <p>they kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,</p>
                    <p>about 10,000 running copies.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>What was fascinating about this,</p>
                    <p>is that it was still played as a game.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,</p>
                    <p>that everyone went to for internet news.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML</p>
                    <p>and to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>It is a Virtual City at heart,</p>
                    <p>but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,</p>
                    <p>it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,</p>
                    <p>because their voting history is under their profile.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,</p>
                    <p>some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program as a whole,</p>
                    <p>eliminated the need for representatives.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People vote on issues that need immediate attention,</p>
                    <p>and those are the first issues that get solved.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Two amazing things emerged from within the program,</p>
                    <p>schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),</p>
                    <p>and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Schools started working,</p>
                    <p>it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The second,</p>
                    <p>people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,</p>
                    <p>people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,</p>
                    <p>the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,</p>
                    <p>any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,</p>
                    <p>there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,</p>
                    <p>so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,</p>
                    <p>one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>The entire process was often ran by bots,</p>
                    <p>city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,</p>
                    <p>were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,</p>
                    <p>the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,</p>
                    <p>they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,</p>
                    <p>they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>
                      This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,</p>
                    again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication
                    to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.<p></p>

                    <p>The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Wisdom is the substance with which Humanity grows,
and it is also the might with which every hero rose.
There cannot be a united world without a wise voter,
systems of politics can&apos;t work like a motor.
Corruption comes out of most people wanting to appear smart,
but their incompetence does not end when they depart.
Not only are they replaced by more of the same,
but the policies they set continue wandering without an aim.
Systems as such expand until they seize and fall,
then from the ashes can only rise a wall after wall.
It is because pretenders when pressed can only pretend more,
liars can only destroy a nation and lead it to war.
A nation must first help its uneducated, poor, and weak,
because poverty prevents people from learning and makes the future bleak.
Then, to power a system the voter must be educated and wise,
otherwise they can only contribute to the system&apos;s demise.
We cannot hope to build a peaceful nation,
if we do not begin with functional and real education.
Cognitive biases  alone,
will corrupt a politician down to the bone.
But their real curse is such,
that they can&apos;t know, that they don&apos;t know very much.
Fake it until you make it, is not a driving force,
it is a mode of being rotten at the source.
Alas, we are too beautiful to allow politicians to sell it all,
we will turn our heads away from their madness and their fall.
A day will come, when they call for their wars,
but we&apos;ll be too busy, tearing down walls, and opening windows, and doors.
The future generations should look towards the internet,
building a world united by a peaceful mindset.
A world build far and above geographic borders,
one that is connected by Education and Compassion, not just orders.
But, we cannot Unite - without Wisdom and Schools,
today we do not yet have the necessary tools.
Non the less, the symbol of the Withe Dove,
will continue waiting for Humanity to unite, in Wisdom and Love.

and find something our elder selves may wish to have known.
We learn best out of curiosity and in need,
and to so start we need a direction and a seed.
A direction is set by something cool,
and a seed makes us feel like we need to go back school.
That&apos;s when you know you have something fun,
something that will challenge you until you are done.
A challenge is a wonderful quest,
something that will keep you learning until you do your best.
Please, stop walking the same road,
take your leap of curiosity; learn to paint, or dance, or code.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Myths were invented to describe amazing people,
and I&apos;ve seen many amazing creatures in my journeys.
One time out in Nordhouse,
out of nowhere popped out a freshly graduated engineer.
He held up a gallon water container that was carrying back to camp,
and the poor mad lad uttered, &quot;8.34 pounds&quot;.
He seemed excited, but also sad,
and I think he was acting so odd because he realized he was forgetting everything.
Plus, I am certain he said pounds,
not kilograms; mad in deed.
Another time, at 6am or so, I was going through maps of south Pacific,
in Ann Arbor, by that strange black metal cube sculpture that squeaks when rotated.
I just had to get away from Ambrosia&apos;s morning clientele,
bless their hearts.
And I&apos;ve noticed that across the park some student was sleeping under an evergreen,
I don&apos;t think she worked in US, I just somehow assumed South America, Amazon.
She stared getting off the ground, and tried to yell that she wasn&apos;t homeless or drunk,
I kept looking into my maps, ignoring her; and she went on her way to get a grant, or give a speech or something.
I am sure she worked in South America,
probably with the natives.
Over in Ludington, there was this one time a little girl was feeding Seagulls with her mom,
and just as I noticed the commotion...
one of the Seagulls,
went, all, out!
Right in her hair,
I felt so bad, and her mother was only barely able to contain her laughter.
She puffed up her face as if playing a trumpet,
you could totally tell she had enough of that kid, and she was getting payback for all her hissy fits.
And then there is this... story that is most Dearest to me,
one of my happiest memories, that I swore I would never talk about because I am far too mature.
Alas, this is what All Hallows&apos; Eve is all about,
talking about strange creatures, and wonderful memories.
It was an beautiful early morning,
I was sitting by my breakfast fire.
Mostly listening to birds, and probably angry bears,
whilst squiggling in my journal, about poems, and programs.
This was a large and beautiful camp site full of tress,
they had clean showers, and proper restrooms.
I had the first camp site on the Orchid Loop,
and I noticed that a couple of giggly middle aged ladies were just getting into the spirit of camping.
They were always happy, and sophisticated,
and laughing, playing some smart radio station, and always full of joy.
This morning the tall one started shimmy shammying first,
she was probably getting around to starting up a fire to make breakfast.
They had all the firewood,
and swe was singing something, it was unusual for people to make so many happy little noises during a stay there.
She quieted down a bit,
and lit her fire.
And as she bent over to pick up some twigs to get things going,
she fired off that old familiar sound that one would expect from a constipated and uncultured, filthy, lactose intolerant old man.
And, oh my gosh,
all of a sudden all the birds went quiet.
It was just this unusual deafening silence,
and that&apos;s just half the story, because all of a sudden this sophisticated wealthy woman goes:
&quot;Puull my finga&quot;
In the worst fake southern accent she could possibly conjure up,
and with the longest drawl.
And then she quickly skedaddled back to her camper,
- probably to change, and lay down a bit.
This must have been ten years ago or more,
and I still haven&apos;t forgotten about it.
Happy Halloween,
Everyone.

                  <span class="text-muted">Some secrets are right there,
in the sand, they lay bare.
For a few days,
I, manned that blaze.
I lit a fire so great,
that it moved me, to create.
I didn&apos;t have much in my tent,
in my wallet, I didn&apos;t have a singe cent.
I lived in a castle, built by a gigantic dune,
its halls hummed that ancient tune.
In the day I&apos;d gather firewood,
come the eve I&apos;d have a potato, that tasted so good.
I neither searched for a beginning nor the end,
I merely wanted to find idea&apos;s edge, to my own content.
It was right there,
but it was not in the horizon, nor the fire&apos;s flare.
It was in living at a proper pace,
and sleeping in the right place.
The pace at which you live your days,
must match your interest, and remain, in phase.
Composing Music and Painting Art,
are unique and worlds apart.
In art we race to paint,
but in music we must practice restraint.
The eye can&apos;t see,
what the ear can hear.
Though both require layers to become thick,
paintings rain, while music goes tick by tick.
Each requires a different place,
and a walk about at a distinct pace.
There are many out there that move all wrong,
sadly, they will never finish their painting, or their song.
And when it was time go back whence I came,
I rolled up my tent, and put out the flame.
Somebody else down the trail, instantly lit another fire,
and pondered their own wisdom, to their own desire.
I waddled back, my painted walking stick in hand,
slowly marking notes, beats, and measures in the sand.
Now, whenever I try to learn something new,
I wait for time to give me a clue.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Invent everything,
we are all extremely smart.
We can learn anything,
so as long as we don&apos;t skip any steps along the way.
And so as long,
as all steps are interesting and fun to us.
Never force yourself to learn something you don&apos;t enjoy,
just keep reading books, and keep looking for something to strike your fancy.
From Dreaming, and Inventing,
to Art, Programming and taking to the skies.
An invention can be as simple,
as an LED Throwie or LED Glowie.
Just a Light Emitting Diode, a battery and magnet,
to keep it all together; and as a bonus make it stick to metal surfaces.
That is a three component invention,
LED, magnet, battery.
My favorite Radio Astronomer,
Seth Shostak.
Quips, that the baseline for determining if a member of a species is intelligent,
is whether or not it can hold a soldering iron, and make a radio.
Allow me to get you soldering a radio,
as quickly as possible.
Get a Raspberry PI Zero W (the W stands for Wireless or &quot;with WI-FI&quot;),
a soldering kit, a solder wick, some GPIO headers,
and a 4 x 8 RGB LED HAT that fits a Raspberry PI Zero neatly.
Look everything up on YouTube,
how to solder, how to solder headers, how to use a solder wick.
This is serious business,
in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.
Though get a $30 kit
that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.
At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,
and set it up on the network.
But later as you figure everything out,
you unplug everything leaving just the power.
To get inside it,
you use a remote terminal.
Once you login,
you get a command prompt.
It listens to words, to commands,
very similar to adventure games.
Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,
are very much like rooms in a game.
To get inside Documents,
type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;
The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,
Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.
When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,
you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.
The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,
just a couple of words and nothing more.
But sometimes, that is not enough,
like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.
We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,
we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.
You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,
it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.
To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,
which is short for list, or list files.
&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,
you can ask it for help like above.
But also ask it to list files in a long format,
by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,
the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.
To list files with readable file sizes,
you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;
Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,
the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,
you just use the short versions.
The command line interface is trying to be your friend,
it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.
There are many tutorials on how to use the command line,
and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference
Here are instructions on how to play audio through HDMI,
your monitor should have an audio out somewhere.
Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,
and try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights based on this tutorial.
Alternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on this instructable,
note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.
And there is also a Raspberry PI WH,
meaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.
And now, get a $10 camera,
and use raspistill to take a photo,
and play around with all the other options.
Now you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,
a programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.
You can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,
you can get an LCD screen and turn it into a tablet.
Raspberry PI is not the only Single-board computer,
PINE looks really nice as well.
If you are looking for a more complicated project,
perhaps try building a Raspberry PI Drone,
bonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.
We have no limits,
but we are also very unique.
Our inventions need not rely on commuters,
some of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.
Don&apos;t let anybody stop you from inventing,
and don&apos;t stop dreaming.
Finally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,
make for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.
Aim,
for the Moon.
