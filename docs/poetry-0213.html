                    <p>It started Christmas 2020, the world was already in trouble;</p>
                    <p>the conjecture in a sentence was this:</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&quot;What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere&quot;,</p>
                    <p>it is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is commonly known as corruption, but that didn&apos;t matter to them,</p>
                    <p>because they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And by everything,</p>
                    <p>they meant institutions all around the world.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>They were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot;,</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,</p>
                    <p>they would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Initially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,</p>
                    <p>but there was a way to find out.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,</p>
                    <p>it was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,</p>
                    <p>the bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>So part of the reason why the programming was so simple,</p>
                    <p>is that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>When everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,</p>
                    <p>and some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,</p>
                    <p>then the program could replace all the management software of a real city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,</p>
                    <p>it took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>They knew that they became famous,</p>
                    <p>when the UN wouldn&apos;t stop calling.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,</p>
                    <p>they kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,</p>
                    <p>about 10,000 running copies.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>What was fascinating about this,</p>
                    <p>is that it was still played as a game.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,</p>
                    <p>that everyone went to for internet news.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML</p>
                    <p>and to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>It is a Virtual City at heart,</p>
                    <p>but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,</p>
                    <p>it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,</p>
                    <p>because their voting history is under their profile.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,</p>
                    <p>some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program as a whole,</p>
                    <p>eliminated the need for representatives.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People vote on issues that need immediate attention,</p>
                    <p>and those are the first issues that get solved.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Two amazing things emerged from within the program,</p>
                    <p>schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),</p>
                    <p>and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Schools started working,</p>
                    <p>it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The second,</p>
                    <p>people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,</p>
                    <p>people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,</p>
                    <p>the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,</p>
                    <p>any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,</p>
                    <p>there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,</p>
                    <p>so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,</p>
                    <p>one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>The entire process was often ran by bots,</p>
                    <p>city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,</p>
                    <p>were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,</p>
                    <p>the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,</p>
                    <p>they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,</p>
                    <p>they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>
                      This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,</p>
                    again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication
                    to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.<p></p>

                    <p>The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">We have traveled to watch Alpha Orionis undergo Supernova,
and to say Hello, to everybody else, who had the same idea.
We have been studying it even before we became space faring species,
we as in all the species that grew up seeing it with their own eyes.
We&apos;re all humanoid here,
carbon based, mostly the same DNA.
We&apos;ve been talking about the Flowers on Earth,
the Poets, and Libraries; Interesting Books.
Earth has become a Nature Preserve,
well, it has always been a nature preserve,
hence the quiet skies.
Early humans had a lot of problems,
and they needed a lot of help.
The oldest of us date back to the first days of the pandemics,
it was a very strange time.
All planets eventually,
emerge dangerous pathogens.
If there is intelligent life, and if it approaches unsustainable,
some form of Contact is made.
In our case, people just stopped aging,
90 year olds reverted back to their 40s.
We got really smart, it took a few decades to piece it all together,
and then we set off to meet the others at Betelgeuse.
And here here we are,
The Final Frontier, to quote Roddenberry.
It is not a good idea to go Planet Side,
precisely because of pathogens.
Once we leave our solar systems,
we all keep to the Stars.
Time travel is available to us,
the space is infinite, in all dimensions.
The worst thing that happened in the universe were Unlucky species dying alone,
we are now in the process of cataloging everybody by moving through the ancient past.
We are all moving towards where it all begun, Methuselah Prime,
the ancient source of all DNA based life.
It will take an Eternity,
but we&apos;ll get there.

                  <span class="text-muted">Here our Heroines discovered that Social Networks could be used as Human Intelligence based Computer,
and that all it required to build entire governments was the concept of nested groups, (mathematically speaking graphs of sets to which users belong to).
Their research revealed that in 1960&apos;s Detroit, Michigan
was one of the largest Model Cities.
And yet again, that old foe of corruption has emerged,
Model Cities were destroyed by &quot;complicated bureaucracy, inadequate funding, and competing agendas at the local level&quot;.
However, the girls have already worked out,
most of the Anti-Corruption measures.
There will be no such thing as a brand,
or guild.
There will be schools that help people come together,
but the people who satisfy tasks will have their school path, rating and comments to serve as their license.
New comes to a field, such as landscaping,
will charge less until they gain high star rating.
If a large group does grow, it will become divided in two or four,
and this decision will be voted on, by the local community.
It is of some note, that a Landscaping Professional,
claiming a bounty for taking care of a particular set of Condominiums, for example,
can accept cash directly from those who posted the landscaping bounty.
Cosmopolis does not extract a fee for completion of a task or exchange of funds,
there is no need for a bank, storing sensitive information, or constant security audits.
It is really important to be able to to imagine a visit from a landscaping professional,
as a function of Cosmopolis, as an intelligent computer dispatching a human to solve a problem.
When temporary switching to this view,
Cosmopolis becomes an entity powered by the intelligence of millions of humans beings.
The extremely simple idea of voting within a group,
is all the force behind Cosmopolis, it is its intelligence.
When a medical professional notices that the community he is part of could use a hospital,
he can file a Request for Change, and all the members of the community will vote yes or no,
Matters as complex as building a hospital require tens of thousands of tasks,
ranging from arranging for funds, to increasing tips, bounties and scholarships,
so that come a near future, the hospital can begin training medical students.
In some cases, simple program logic will trigger the call for voting on building a new Hospital,
and then human beings will bring in their Intelligence and Expertise.
This scenario serves as an example of Deus Ex Machina,
an intelligent machine powered by Massively Multiuser Self Assembling Intelligence (MMSAI)

                  <span class="text-muted">Once, late at night,
I was prancing in the moonlight.
Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,
and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.
There was an occasional bark or a howl,
but it didn&apos;t get scary till I heard an owl.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she said,
&quot;I am about to swoop down and peck y&apos;all dead.&quot;
&quot;No, thank you Dear Madam&quot;, I sweetly replied,
as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - I heard,
to which I yelled now at a gallop &quot;I ain&apos;t afraid of no bird.&quot;
&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,
squirting urine at every step.
And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,
and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.
I was lucky, and my camp was near,
legend has it that she&apos;s still out there filling the woods with fear.
So if if you&apos;re ever out there, and hear a hoot,
better grab onto your butt, and scoot.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">To learn something you must hunger for it,
to learn something, you must love it.
To learn something, you must enjoy it so much, that you will put it aside,
and learn the stuff beneath it first, to grant yourself a fair chance at mastery.
Every little bit counts,
but only if it comes in a sequence that fits what you have already learned.
If you attempt to learn things out of sequence,
or worse yet, trust someone to teach you,
it won&apos;t work, it never has, it never will, forget it.
And it is not just sequence,
it is also the speed at which you learn, that must be taken under consideration.
Sequence and Pace,
now that is just the barbarian level of learning, meant for warriors.
You, can do better than that,
you certainly should.
When you learn is important,
night owls will learn at a different time of day than others.
It is the environment that matters,
some people can&apos;t learn in a city and will needs trees and mountains.
And, the geographic location matters too, if you love numbers, and calculus calls to you,
visit Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz at Neust&#xE4;dter Kirche in Hanover Germany,
visit Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey in London, England.
And remember, Sciences are learned not by memorizing facts,
but by tracing their development across the ages.
Schools are here to teach us,
but they don&apos;t know how.
What they do know,
is how to fake it,
and make it appear like you are learning.
The motive is simple,
for as long as the school gets funding,
everyone gets to keep their job.
Yes,
it is fraud.
Yes, they are selling your mind for a small paycheck,
the curriculum is impossible to learn from.
Curriculum is stitched out of questions that you will have to pass later on,
so that the school can continue to operate, they just want you to retain most of it,
and they will expect you to cram before that test too.
If you want to become a Doctor, Scientist, Mathematician,
you need to be going to a real school, that will encourage you to learn in optimal ways,
a public school is not the optimal setting for education.
A public school is primary for babysitting,
so that you&apos;re not home alone trying to set your or the sticky bandits hair on fire.
In order for that school to exist,
teachers need to get paid,
so you need to pretend to learn by just memorizing,
and passing tests, your grades help the school continue to operate.
Nobody cares if you are learning,
or memorizing.
To graduate with a good GPA, you will have to memorize,
and it will be disconnected facts, they will be out of sequence,
they cannot possibly fit what you already know, and you will forget it all.
In return for hoop jumping you will get a diploma,
and will be accepted to college or university if you cram for the SAT and entrance exams.
In college, your education will be slowed down,
it will be called, balanced education, and they will say it with a straight face like a cult member.
The text books will be $300, lectures $500,
and you can apply for Medical School from here, and move on.
It is hinted that Panama Papers are a good example of what is going on,
there is no central organization that encourages corruption,
it is just that everyone is looking for a shortcut.
You can stand up in class,
but everyone jobs are at stake.
You will be accused of disrupting the class,
and you will be suspended.
They will stress you out,
they will make you tired,
they will make you drop out.
Let me just say,
that you are not allowed to stand by when someone is getting hurt.
If the teacher or security are acting creepy,
talk to the principal, explain that the second time it happens, you will call the police.
The teachers, in their haste will give up on the students in the back,
they have fallen behind on material, but now they are being made to feel that they are unintelligent,
this will destroy their minds, this will cause great harm to their self esteem,
they need your help, get them audio books, Bill Bryson and Carl Sagan.
I think most teachers, when pressured,
will tell you that you are expected to learn on your own,
and in effect confess, that they are useless, when it comes to teaching you for real.
That the classroom is about standardized testing,
for which it is easier to force you to memorize disconnected bits of knowledge that you will soon forget,
then to actually craft a curriculum that will fit all the students,
and match their existing knowledge,
and the natural pace at which they learn,
and their personality.
It used to be true that a single teacher cannot approach all their students in a way that will help them learn,
so to stay in business, they would force them into memorization.
But today, that is not the case. Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,
is because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.
Today, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,
interactive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,
it is possible to approach each student individually,
I am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.
There is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,
that is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.
Even now, I can&apos;t see everything that has gone wrong,
schools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.
But even so, the fact remains,
today schools can&apos;t teach.
They are wicked good,
at tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.
At the end of the day,
you will still need an education.
Your only safe bet,
is becoming self taught,
independent study.
And please, don&apos;t let anybody call you a Genius,
help others, help them find knowledge too.
Finally,
I describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,
on a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.
But, I do know one thing for certain,
this is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.
This is a call for heroism,
for courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.
This is how Life asks for help,
you are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.
Become a Great Being,
Fix Schools.

but life is not to be lived quietly.
If you are not shaking, and you voice is not broken, from screaming an yelling at the Congress,
when they called you in for questioning - but they had to drag you out,
for screaming - about the disgrace of insider trading, and corruption.
Because you couldn&apos;t keep yourself from being a bright dying star,
out of the potential they held to inspire and move, and educate generations.
If you aren&apos;t standing at the Diag, making the moron that was just there shaking with anger,
because you took his microphone, and you started quoting Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Dennett, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali,
Because it is just enough of evil for that particular day,
and you would, save the sunset by bringing in the Saints.
And if you never painted you car pink, especially the interior, because the Pepto Bismol didn&apos;t work,
and you had nowhere to go and noting to eat, but forward and a bag of stale old chips.
Because you couldn&apos;t put the books down,
for all the Love and Wisdom in there.
Why Henry went into the woods at Walden,
and what happened to Gregor Samsa in Metamorphosis,
and how beautifully Will Durant opened his Story to Philosophy,
&quot;Grow strong, my comrade &#x2026; that you may stand
Unshaken when I fall; that I may know
The shattered fragments of my song will come
At last to finer melody in you;
That I may tell my heart that you begin
Where passing I leave off, and fathom more.&quot;
My Friends,
we are not to live quiet little lives,
because we only get one each.
And the way to turn the volume up,
is to inherit wisdom from all the great beings,
at all cost at any cost,
because without their light we can&apos;t tell where we are going.
Get you audio books ready,
and listen, just learn,
listen to all those lives.
All those great beings,
are sharing lifetimes of wisdom with you.
Endure.
Listen.
Teach.
Move Mountains.
