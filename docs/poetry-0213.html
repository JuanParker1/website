                    <p>It started Christmas 2020, the world was already in trouble;</p>
                    <p>the conjecture in a sentence was this:</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&quot;What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere&quot;,</p>
                    <p>it is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It is commonly known as corruption, but that didn&apos;t matter to them,</p>
                    <p>because they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>And by everything,</p>
                    <p>they meant institutions all around the world.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>

                  <section>
                    <p>They were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot;,</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,</p>
                    <p>they would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Initially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,</p>
                    <p>but there was a way to find out.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,</p>
                    <p>it was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <hr>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,</p>
                    <p>the bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>So part of the reason why the programming was so simple,</p>
                    <p>is that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>When everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,</p>
                    <p>and some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,</p>
                    <p>then the program could replace all the management software of a real city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,</p>
                    <p>it took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                    <p>They knew that they became famous,</p>
                    <p>when the UN wouldn&apos;t stop calling.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,</p>
                    <p>they kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,</p>
                    <p>about 10,000 running copies.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>What was fascinating about this,</p>
                    <p>is that it was still played as a game.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,</p>
                    <p>that everyone went to for internet news.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML</p>
                    <p>and to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>It is a Virtual City at heart,</p>
                    <p>but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,</p>
                    <p>it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,</p>
                    <p>because their voting history is under their profile.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,</p>
                    <p>some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The program as a whole,</p>
                    <p>eliminated the need for representatives.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People vote on issues that need immediate attention,</p>
                    <p>and those are the first issues that get solved.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>Two amazing things emerged from within the program,</p>
                    <p>schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),</p>
                    <p>and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Schools started working,</p>
                    <p>it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The second,</p>
                    <p>people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,</p>
                    <p>people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,</p>
                    <p>the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,</p>
                    <p>any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,</p>
                    <p>there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,</p>
                    <p>so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,</p>
                    <p>one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.</p>

                  <section>
                    <p>The entire process was often ran by bots,</p>
                    <p>city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,</p>
                    <p>were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,</p>
                    <p>the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,</p>
                    <p>they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,</p>
                    <p>they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>
                      This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,</p>
                    again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication
                    to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.<p></p>

                    <p>The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,</p>

it is for you so that you may live a beautiful and meaningful life.
It cannot be sold or rented,
because it is priceless.
Nor, can you give it away,
under any circumstance.
Everybody that has something to gain,
will try to push you to work past your limit.
You can&apos;t allow that,
your life is not meant to be spent on work.
You should only work enough,
so that you are safe.
It is hard to keep a balanced existence,
but we must always search and never give in.
We are not machines, nor cogs in one,
we are Music, Poetry, Great Thinker and Dreamers.
We have to protect what makes us beautiful,
overwork can only prevent us from fixing the world.
We are each meant to become well-read,
knowledgeable, wise and an outspoken inspiration to many.
The younger generations are always in need of Great Teachers,
as they all to easily accept the status quo.
All the world nations require great improvement,
and to change the world, we can only rely on Wisdom.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Might is meant for battle only,
when battles end, we must return to balance.
Life is meant to revolve around cheerfulness,
or sweet mischief if you are one of those.
It is fueled by knowledge,
driven by wisdom, all towards greatness.
It matters that we are good to ourselves,
that we care about our body and mind.
Some battles such as World Peace,
can&apos;t yet be fought, and we must not try.
If something is too big,
then it will take our cheerfulness and life away.
There is much in the world that needs repair,
but first the world must become wiser.
Before a battle for World Peace is fought,
we must repair schools.
And before we take to repairing schools,
we must first speak out about what is wrong with them.
The wiser our approach to such great endeavors,
the more you will see that it calls for clear thinking.
And clear thinking cannot come,
out of an unbalanced mind.
It requires peace, and cheerfulness, the sun and the moon,
ocean sunshine, snowy adventures, and fragrant woods.
We must be kind to ourselves,
as in haste of might, all our life may pass us by.
And so I offer a small purrsciption,
to ensure that you are forever well.
Above all,
slow down.
Ensure that have time to listen to an audio book each week,
the book need not be long but it must be fascinating.
Prepare a tent and a backpack for this summer,
even if it is just for camping in your backyard.
Get a Mini Projector to trace photos on canvas,
and get some good watercolors, oils or pencils to begin study art.
And to keep heath, search the internet for Dance Tutorials,
and let the music move your body.
You can be sure that you live in balance within your self,
when you have time for self improvement and keeping healthy.
If this is something that you can&apos;t do,
then you must learn to love yourself more, and try harder.
Your health and the way you treat yourself in life,
must be the first and foremost concern.
Because, if you can&apos;t or don&apos;t care about yourself,
then many others will be too scared to care for you.
Haste and Might are handy,
but just for a little while.
Balance, Creativity, Peace, and Health,
is how life is meant to be lived.
Do not be scared to switch majors, or carers, or continents,
be good to yourself, strive to be cheerful.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Learn and make haste slowly,
examine life in search for wisdom.
When someone pulls you,
stand your ground.
When someone frightens you,
leave.
You will find no answers,
except, for one place.
Call it the Library,
Books, Video Lectures, or Audio Books.
The only people that deliver Components of Wisdom,
are the authors of top selling non-fiction.
Schools and Nations,
are overwhelmed.
Clogged with uneducated pretenders,
incapable of vision.
They proclaim World Peace,
to be stupid.
And parade Mutually Assured Destruction,
instead.
Grow strong and free,
and learn to no end.
Nobody is coming,
to deliver wisdom unto you.
You!
have to go get the books yourself.
Do not wait,
your knowledge dictates all your decisions.
There are too many liars,
too much mediocrity.
Too much hidden in plain sight,
beneath a shroud of inaction.
The quest for World Peace,
is in your hands now.
The Great Search for Wisdom and Greatness,
awaits you.
Please,
do not delay.
For you are meant to become
a Great Being.
You are to lead the change,
the little ones will soon hope for.
In an incomplete world,
we can&apos;t rest.
Rise for Education, Truth, Peace,
Equality, Freedom and Justice.
The future now begs that all children
are taught to become Great Beings.
May the World grow,
with Knowledge, Love, Wisdom, and Foresight.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">The educational shortcut,
is always a lie.
The only thing we will find in a shortcut,
is a fantasy or fairy tale, an impression of education, or make-believe success.
There is really no need to take shortcuts in life,
learning and growing up is beautiful.
Growing up, is an act of endless tiny adventures,
as you pursue your little curiosities onward to wisdom.
Most adventures are very poetic, adventures in spirit so to speak,
such as learning to paint low-brow art with oil on canvas, whilst listening to Kenji Kawai.
Many adventures are actual expeditions that involve backpacks and sometimes even tents,
it still counts, when you only camp in your backyard; an adventure is an adventure.
The more advanced art of listening to audio books when hiking through a little wilderness,
is so pleasant, so relaxing and educational that no one should want to skip it.
When books are read to us,
we really connect with what the author is saying.
Reading books with our own inner-voice, is not perfect because we bring in our own worries and tone,
the book is always tethered down with what is going on in our life and what comes tomorrow.
Books are stories that must be told with passion,
and by an external voice, with some approval from the author; if not the author her self.
It is not possible to walk through the woods, and sticks and roots,
and read a book in such a way that we can hear the author try to teach us wisdom.
Yes, it is important that we walk through green valleys and fragrant woodlands,
it is not the same to listen to a book in the busy streets of a city full of strangers.
Nature has a very powerful impact on us,
it makes us slow down, it makes us calmer, we sleep at sunset and awake at sun rise.
Without fears, distractions, and the hurry of the busy life,
books begin fitting into our lifestyle as our heart begins to call for wisdom.
Nature and Books are opposite of shortcuts, they
create very long and wise lives.
This is a lifestyle of learning and growing up,
it cannot hurt us, it can only make us better, and it will spare us mistakes.
In this kind of life,
no one will push you to hurry up.
No one will frighten you, or lie to you,
here you just cheerfully move at your own speed.
Always thinking,
and always learning, always growing up.
In the life that we are all expected to live,
people lie when they say college will grant you a successful career.
Only you can guarantee yourself a successful career,
and you have to start very early, maybe as early as middle-school.
You have to begin thinking about co-founding a series of tiny companies
that will help you learn about business, and what it means to be a leader, a founder, and a CEO.
You have to discover and follow your passions,
and further your inventions.
Real investors don&apos;t care much for a sales pitch with an elevator cartoon,
they look for genius, passion, sanity, and long therm visions.
On the other hand working for somebody else under several management layers,
does not guarantee a healthy career.
We maybe forced into stress, overwork,
and have all our balance drained from us.
Just because we can work at a breakneck speed,
it does not mean that we should, that kind of lifestyle is very dangerous.
Servitude of this kind will make us age faster,
long after the bosses tried to tell us &quot;life is not fair&quot; we will still suffer from effects of overwork.
We must keep a healthy balance with day and night and nature,
we are not machines, we are poetry.
There are no shortcuts,
and learning is beautiful.
For one you never stop learning, and two; life never stops challenging you,
and three, you must live healthy.
Take good care of your self,
it is the lifetimes of wisdom you inherit from all the books that make the biggest difference.
Life is meant to be lived beautifully and cheerfully;
consciousness is such an impossible gift from the Universe, that without a doubt, you are meant to be happy.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Knowledge has an enormous impact on decision making,
if you don&apos;t know enough you maybe taken advantage of.
You gain knowledge by means of authentic education,
an education that has maximum impact on your existence.
Memorization or cramming is not an authentic education,
it is not any kind of education.
You don&apos;t want to rely on a doctor that memorized everything in school,
professionals must look things up to keep up with changes.
Memorization is only good for two things,
passing tests, and getting you ready for a factory job on an assembly line.
And on the other end, tests are for teachers to keep their jobs,
and principals to keep getting funding.
You have to make sure that you are not getting sold for a money,
that you are not being used to sustain an outdated industry.
And above all, do not let them trick you into thinking yo are not smart,
we are all extremely smart, we are all, without exception extremely good at learning for real.
The problem is with schools, they are trying to use a single teacher,
to teach anywhere between 30 and 300 students.
There is no way that a teacher can handle that,
so they will make up tests so that majority passes and damn the rest.
Memorization is just a temporary circus trick,
make sure you are learning meaningful things that have lasting impact.
Real education will multiply you,
fake education will make a fool out of you.
Decision-making is one of the most important things in life,
we need Real Education, Real Knowledge to help us make correct decisions in life.
Many of the decisions we make early on,
have long term impact that continues for decades in not for life.
It also matters that we grow up in an authentic culture,
if we are surrounded by lairs that too will contribute to push us off the path we want to be on.
You must ask if perhaps the school industry is using outdated teaching methods
that barely worked during industrial revolution, to keep getting government money.
Every student in every country,
from middle school to university must to check if they are really learning for real.
Real education is one that enriches a person with Knowledge gained in previous generations,
real education provides many lifetimes of knowledge in a beautifully arranged bouquet.
In turn, that Knowledge grows in you as its components become your own building blocks,
and help you to become Strong, Happy, Wise, Beautiful,
and eventually help you become a Great Being, one who makes lasting contributions to Human Kind.</span>
