                    <p>This is serious business,</p>
                    <p>in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Though <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Vilros+Raspberry+Pi+Zero+W+Basic+Starter+Kit&amp;ia=web">get a $30 kit</a></p>
                    <p>that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,</p>
                    <p>and set it up on the network.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But later as you figure everything out,</p>
                    <p>you unplug everything leaving just the power.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To get inside it,</p>
                    <p>you use a remote terminal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Once you login,</p>
                    <p>you get a command prompt.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It listens to words, to commands,</p>
                    <p>very similar to adventure games.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,</p>
                    <p>are very much like rooms in a game.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To get inside Documents,</p>
                    <p>type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,</p>
                    <p>Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,</p>
                    <p>you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,</p>
                    <p>just a couple of words and nothing more.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But sometimes, that is not enough,</p>
                    <p>like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,</p>
                    <p>we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,</p>
                    <p>it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,</p>
                    <p>which is short for list, or list files.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,</p>
                    <p>you can ask it for help like above.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But also ask it to list files in a long format,</p>
                    <p>by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,</p>
                    <p>the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To list files with readable file sizes,</p>
                    <p>you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,</p>
                    <p>the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,</p>
                    <p>you just use the short versions.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The command line interface is trying to be your friend,</p>
                    <p>it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=raspberry+pi+terminal+command+line">many tutorials</a> on how to use the command line,</p>
                    <p>and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=O%27Reilly+Bash+Pocket+Reference&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference</a></p>

                    <p>Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,</p>

                  <section>

                    <p>note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Might is meant for battle only,
when battles end, we must return to balance.
Life is meant to revolve around cheerfulness,
or sweet mischief if you are one of those.
It is fueled by knowledge,
driven by wisdom, all towards greatness.
It matters that we are good to ourselves,
that we care about our body and mind.
Some battles such as World Peace,
can&apos;t yet be fought, and we must not try.
If something is too big,
then it will take our cheerfulness and life away.
There is much in the world that needs repair,
but first the world must become wiser.
Before a battle for World Peace is fought,
we must repair schools.
And before we take to repairing schools,
we must first speak out about what is wrong with them.
The wiser our approach to such great endeavors,
the more you will see that it calls for clear thinking.
And clear thinking cannot come,
out of an unbalanced mind.
It requires peace, and cheerfulness, the sun and the moon,
ocean sunshine, snowy adventures, and fragrant woods.
We must be kind to ourselves,
as in haste of might, all our life may pass us by.
And so I offer a small purrsciption,
to ensure that you are forever well.
Above all,
slow down.
Ensure that have time to listen to an audio book each week,
the book need not be long but it must be fascinating.
Prepare a tent and a backpack for this summer,
even if it is just for camping in your backyard.
Get a Mini Projector to trace photos on canvas,
and get some good watercolors, oils or pencils to begin study art.
And to keep heath, search the internet for Dance Tutorials,
and let the music move your body.
You can be sure that you live in balance within your self,
when you have time for self improvement and keeping healthy.
If this is something that you can&apos;t do,
then you must learn to love yourself more, and try harder.
Your health and the way you treat yourself in life,
must be the first and foremost concern.
Because, if you can&apos;t or don&apos;t care about yourself,
then many others will be too scared to care for you.
Haste and Might are handy,
but just for a little while.
Balance, Creativity, Peace, and Health,
is how life is meant to be lived.
Do not be scared to switch majors, or carers, or continents,
be good to yourself, strive to be cheerful.</span>

examine life in search for wisdom.
When someone pulls you,
stand your ground.
When someone frightens you,
leave.
You will find no answers,
except, for one place.
Call it the Library,
Books, Video Lectures, or Audio Books.
The only people that deliver Components of Wisdom,
are the authors of top selling non-fiction.
Schools and Nations,
are overwhelmed.
Clogged with uneducated pretenders,
incapable of vision.
They proclaim World Peace,
to be stupid.
And parade Mutually Assured Destruction,
instead.
Grow strong and free,
and learn to no end.
Nobody is coming,
to deliver wisdom unto you.
You!
have to go get the books yourself.
Do not wait,
your knowledge dictates all your decisions.
There are too many liars,
too much mediocrity.
Too much hidden in plain sight,
beneath a shroud of inaction.
The quest for World Peace,
is in your hands now.
The Great Search for Wisdom and Greatness,
awaits you.
Please,
do not delay.
For you are meant to become
a Great Being.
You are to lead the change,
the little ones will soon hope for.
In an incomplete world,
we can&apos;t rest.
Rise for Education, Truth, Peace,
Equality, Freedom and Justice.
The future now begs that all children
are taught to become Great Beings.
May the World grow,
with Knowledge, Love, Wisdom, and Foresight.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">The educational shortcut,
is always a lie.
The only thing we will find in a shortcut,
is a fantasy or fairy tale, an impression of education, or make-believe success.
There is really no need to take shortcuts in life,
learning and growing up is beautiful.
Growing up, is an act of endless tiny adventures,
as you pursue your little curiosities onward to wisdom.
Most adventures are very poetic, adventures in spirit so to speak,
such as learning to paint low-brow art with oil on canvas, whilst listening to Kenji Kawai.
Many adventures are actual expeditions that involve backpacks and sometimes even tents,
it still counts, when you only camp in your backyard; an adventure is an adventure.
The more advanced art of listening to audio books when hiking through a little wilderness,
is so pleasant, so relaxing and educational that no one should want to skip it.
When books are read to us,
we really connect with what the author is saying.
Reading books with our own inner-voice, is not perfect because we bring in our own worries and tone,
the book is always tethered down with what is going on in our life and what comes tomorrow.
Books are stories that must be told with passion,
and by an external voice, with some approval from the author; if not the author her self.
It is not possible to walk through the woods, and sticks and roots,
and read a book in such a way that we can hear the author try to teach us wisdom.
Yes, it is important that we walk through green valleys and fragrant woodlands,
it is not the same to listen to a book in the busy streets of a city full of strangers.
Nature has a very powerful impact on us,
it makes us slow down, it makes us calmer, we sleep at sunset and awake at sun rise.
Without fears, distractions, and the hurry of the busy life,
books begin fitting into our lifestyle as our heart begins to call for wisdom.
Nature and Books are opposite of shortcuts, they
create very long and wise lives.
This is a lifestyle of learning and growing up,
it cannot hurt us, it can only make us better, and it will spare us mistakes.
In this kind of life,
no one will push you to hurry up.
No one will frighten you, or lie to you,
here you just cheerfully move at your own speed.
Always thinking,
and always learning, always growing up.
In the life that we are all expected to live,
people lie when they say college will grant you a successful career.
Only you can guarantee yourself a successful career,
and you have to start very early, maybe as early as middle-school.
You have to begin thinking about co-founding a series of tiny companies
that will help you learn about business, and what it means to be a leader, a founder, and a CEO.
You have to discover and follow your passions,
and further your inventions.
Real investors don&apos;t care much for a sales pitch with an elevator cartoon,
they look for genius, passion, sanity, and long therm visions.
On the other hand working for somebody else under several management layers,
does not guarantee a healthy career.
We maybe forced into stress, overwork,
and have all our balance drained from us.
Just because we can work at a breakneck speed,
it does not mean that we should, that kind of lifestyle is very dangerous.
Servitude of this kind will make us age faster,
long after the bosses tried to tell us &quot;life is not fair&quot; we will still suffer from effects of overwork.
We must keep a healthy balance with day and night and nature,
we are not machines, we are poetry.
There are no shortcuts,
and learning is beautiful.
For one you never stop learning, and two; life never stops challenging you,
and three, you must live healthy.
Take good care of your self,
it is the lifetimes of wisdom you inherit from all the books that make the biggest difference.
Life is meant to be lived beautifully and cheerfully;
consciousness is such an impossible gift from the Universe, that without a doubt, you are meant to be happy.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Knowledge has an enormous impact on decision making,
if you don&apos;t know enough you maybe taken advantage of.
You gain knowledge by means of authentic education,
an education that has maximum impact on your existence.
Memorization or cramming is not an authentic education,
it is not any kind of education.
You don&apos;t want to rely on a doctor that memorized everything in school,
professionals must look things up to keep up with changes.
Memorization is only good for two things,
passing tests, and getting you ready for a factory job on an assembly line.
And on the other end, tests are for teachers to keep their jobs,
and principals to keep getting funding.
You have to make sure that you are not getting sold for a money,
that you are not being used to sustain an outdated industry.
And above all, do not let them trick you into thinking yo are not smart,
we are all extremely smart, we are all, without exception extremely good at learning for real.
The problem is with schools, they are trying to use a single teacher,
to teach anywhere between 30 and 300 students.
There is no way that a teacher can handle that,
so they will make up tests so that majority passes and damn the rest.
Memorization is just a temporary circus trick,
make sure you are learning meaningful things that have lasting impact.
Real education will multiply you,
fake education will make a fool out of you.
Decision-making is one of the most important things in life,
we need Real Education, Real Knowledge to help us make correct decisions in life.
Many of the decisions we make early on,
have long term impact that continues for decades in not for life.
It also matters that we grow up in an authentic culture,
if we are surrounded by lairs that too will contribute to push us off the path we want to be on.
You must ask if perhaps the school industry is using outdated teaching methods
that barely worked during industrial revolution, to keep getting government money.
Every student in every country,
from middle school to university must to check if they are really learning for real.
Real education is one that enriches a person with Knowledge gained in previous generations,
real education provides many lifetimes of knowledge in a beautifully arranged bouquet.
In turn, that Knowledge grows in you as its components become your own building blocks,
and help you to become Strong, Happy, Wise, Beautiful,
and eventually help you become a Great Being, one who makes lasting contributions to Human Kind.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Real Education, makes you, more you,
it greatly enhances your all predispositions.
No one has the right to hold you in contempt for your talents,
no one has the right to tell you who you should become.
All pursuits of excellence lead to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,
the longer it takes the more precious the result.
Ignore the so called teachers that will try to control you, or sway you off your path,
their only wish is to make their own lives easier even if it means sacrificing who you are.
Real education is somehow completely misunderstood,
and people do end up getting lost in life.
For example, some may enjoy a single subject,
and fall behind on all the rest.
Then, to fix their grades,
they are made to focus on fixing subjects that they are bad at.
In the process they interrupt themselves,
they are made to interfere with their own, more-real education.
And, here the beneficiary is the teacher and the dean,
and the reward is eventual raises for keeping GPAs stable.
Long after these frauds are gone,
their victims suffer, never having found a comfortable place.
Sometimes, even after the fools are gone people continue feeling guilt for their talents,
they become convinced that doodles are dumb, and poems are stupid.
It is hard to find happiness in doing things that we don&apos;t care about,
it maybe impossible even.
A life void of happiness,
is a life of depression and constant anxiety.
Even the smallest of our predispositions will develop into unique greatness,
a greatness that is hard to see at first, hard to reason about.
Let me make this clear, Real Education is not about getting a job,
it is about becoming a Great Being, who has much more to add.
And some people,
are a little bit ahead of their time.
For example kids that like to fly drones,
may never fully get into it, unless...
they get access to drones equipped with cameras,
that they can steer through a VR helmet, as if they were piloting them.
If they stick with it,
they will enter electronics, mathematics and software development.
If they get bored, or can&apos;t afford the hardware,
then they will lose something of themselves.
Rule of thumb here,
is to take a predisposition all the way, at all cost.
Hobbies or silly interests are gateways into sciences,
and should always be honored and seen as something very special.
One massive problem is the teachers and parents,
who when lacking similar predispositions will tend to destroy talent.
And they do it because they don&apos;t want their kid to stick out,
they don&apos;t need the extras and the questions that come along with them.
They may say that games are for children,
and talents are useless.
They will say such things because they can&apos;t handle life,
as someone took their talent away and now everything is cumbersome and more than they bargain for.
Coupled with organized and standardized schooling
that divide subjects into meaninglessness and noise that can only be memorized.
Sprinkle in some bullies,
that hate kids that stick out.
All that on top of already bad grades,
as the student may not even be aware that everyone is just memorizing.
And much is lost,
and most permanently.
Real Education is a source of joy, strength,
and contributes to love of life.
The effects of real education
are hard to describe.
It is the different between a pop star, and a girl forced to repeat the semester because she used to like music.
It is the difference between,
a quickly forgotten politician and a famous philosopher that continues to inspire generations.
Between a writer that dabbles in forgettable romance novels,
and one that helps us to understand a strange world of tyranny without tyrants one that we must reject.
Real education creates beings that change lives,
their Works come out of Greatness, nobly fueled by Wisdom and Knowledge.
To deny the becoming of a Great Being is to deny Growing Up,
it means to deny joy, happiness, and love of life.
Everyone is acting as if Greatness and Great Wisdom is rare,
all the while they are stopping each other from a Real Education.
It is Real Education that brings people into areas of Knowledge that they are predisposed to further,
granting them Wisdom, and eventually Greatness.
People who conspire against talent,
are Guidance Counselors, Teachers, and Parents, precisely those who are meant to encourage it.
We must honor the talents and predispositions of the younger generations,
by building personalized educational systems that lead them to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
We must remove all barriers that stand in their way,
the future of the world is in their hands.
