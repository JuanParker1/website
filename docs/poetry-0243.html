                    <p>This is serious business,</p>
                    <p>in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Though <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Vilros+Raspberry+Pi+Zero+W+Basic+Starter+Kit&amp;ia=web">get a $30 kit</a></p>
                    <p>that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,</p>
                    <p>and set it up on the network.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But later as you figure everything out,</p>
                    <p>you unplug everything leaving just the power.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To get inside it,</p>
                    <p>you use a remote terminal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Once you login,</p>
                    <p>you get a command prompt.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It listens to words, to commands,</p>
                    <p>very similar to adventure games.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,</p>
                    <p>are very much like rooms in a game.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To get inside Documents,</p>
                    <p>type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,</p>
                    <p>Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,</p>
                    <p>you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,</p>
                    <p>just a couple of words and nothing more.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But sometimes, that is not enough,</p>
                    <p>like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,</p>
                    <p>we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,</p>
                    <p>it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,</p>
                    <p>which is short for list, or list files.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,</p>
                    <p>you can ask it for help like above.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But also ask it to list files in a long format,</p>
                    <p>by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,</p>
                    <p>the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To list files with readable file sizes,</p>
                    <p>you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,</p>
                    <p>the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,</p>
                    <p>you just use the short versions.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The command line interface is trying to be your friend,</p>
                    <p>it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=raspberry+pi+terminal+command+line">many tutorials</a> on how to use the command line,</p>
                    <p>and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=O%27Reilly+Bash+Pocket+Reference&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference</a></p>

                    <p>Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,</p>

                  <section>

                    <p>note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">When you drive long enough,
you will inevitably find yourself far away from everything.
Now, you have to be courageous,
as first few days are going to be filled with doubt.
Once you get through it,
and the daily stresses let go of you, you will become you.
And if you give it long enough,
you&apos;ll find yourself wondering how you got here.
The answer is almost always,
&quot;By making excuses for people, that didn&apos;t deserve them.&quot;
This falls back on judging people by that age,
and not by their wisdom, class, and maturity.
Anybody can age,
but the pursuit of wisdom is a great challenge.
Just as soon as you stop making excuses,
as you stop filling in the blanks, you are placed on a path towards wisdom.
While you do need your books,
and narrated books are best, the journey is also very important.
You can&apos;t hear the wisdom of a book,
until you get on that path.
And let me precisely state what that path is,
so that there is no room for confusion here.
It is,
The Path Of Adventure.
I was sitting in my coffee shop,
I went there because it once had Tolstoy on the bookshelves.
But, I&apos;ve noticed that things have changed,
and people were not growing up, they were running in circles, curving inwards.
I sat in the rocking chair,
it was the first time, it felt nice.
I rose,
and made it to Tennessee.
I could feel the Spirit of Adventure,
but there was this enormous responsibility to help people grow.
I was too young to be heard,
though I have a faint memory of someone calling me Mother Hen somewhere.
Georgia, I made it to Georgia next,
but instead of turning around, I slept at a rest area.
I woke up, and kept going,
until the highways I was on, turned to US Highway One.
I pulled up by the beautiful beach,
and I walked into the Amazing and warm Ocean.
Standing On The Edge Of The Universe,
I called it.
It was wonderful,
the stars came out, I&apos;ve noticed little glowy fishes swimming about.
On my way pack,
I shout right past my city, and kept on driving.
And yet again I ended up on another beach,
this time in Ludington, Michigan.
Here I overheard someone mention,
Nordhouse Dunes.
I set off immediate, I&apos;ve never seen dunes that big before,
they looked like mountains, to me.
I begun sleeping at a different campsite each day,
then I discovered a little dune that reminded me of a volcano.
And I have spent many days there,
I have listened to many audio books on top of my little volcano.
I discovered how much there is to wisdom,
and what is more, that most of our wisdom has to come from within us.
Daily stresses, and unimportant worries,
trying to speak to people who never listen, is not healthy.
Before we try to help others grow,
we must become wise, and much, much older.
People must be ready to listen,
before they can hear and comprehend what you are sharing.
Express your concern for others,
but not by being pulled into problems of people that don&apos;t listen.
Write, and narrate your books, write to those who are searching for wisdom,
and you will be heard and adored the world over.
Now, go set off on your beautiful adventure,
may you discover all the wisdom and fathom more.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Sometimes writing journals becomes a chore,
because page after page the darn thing begs for more.
Slowly it becomes a bore,
and so as we grow, writing turns into a thing of yore.
I think, writing poetry is the best,
as here your language takes you on a little quest.
You can write very little and even in jest,
and it still comes out with grrrreat zest.
Moreover,
many do not wish to read long pages,
as getting to the end would take them whooooole ages.
And, some may wish to read your thing twice,
or may even wish to enjoy it thrice.
And here brevity is king,
short little things are just the thing.
So if it has been a long time since you writ,
dig up your journal and lay down some fancy wit.
And if you never wrote before, you&apos;re in luck,
lookup word families or find a a rhyming dictionary, and pluck!</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each lesson must add to the next one,
we hardly need to push ourselves.
It sooo important that you start with something you like,
it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.
There area always extras that come alongside,
and they change everything.
Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,
maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.
Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,
you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.
I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,
but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.
Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,
it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.
A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,
sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.
One example that comes to mind is the Ohm&apos;s Law,
you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.
Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,
you can&apos;t connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.
So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,
then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.
Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,
you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.
You see what the problem is, of course,
in schools, they don&apos;t teach by means of practical applications.
They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,
which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.
If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,
and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.
But they don&apos;t do that,
we have to do that.
And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,
it is all those little things we are interested in.
And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,
they won&apos;t know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.
See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,
so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.
And then come our retirement, we&apos;ll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,
and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.
It is the only way the world can grow,
and there is much growing up ahead of us.

that is the rule above all rules.
That is the advice, above all advice,
that is the last sacred wisdom.
The adults can have whatever they want, and a full measure of happiness,
so as long as it does not interfere with your rise to greatness.
Whatever stands in your way, gods, royalty, governments and armies, laws,
traditions, parents, friends, schools, fairy tales, and curfews.
Is null and void,
by the power of the Universe, by the power of Reality.
Do you hear me?
all that matters is that you become a Great Being and Help Humanity Grow.
And armies will come to twist and lie, deport and enslave,
warp and punish, judge and sentence.
But they do not fight you,
they fight reality.
Those who fight reality,
can only destroy themselves.
You, you begin,
by inheriting reason and wisdom.
Whether you rise in camps, prisons or battles,
school libraries, or by shouting poems at the cafeteria.
Wisdom is the first and foremost,
and what must follow; is your rise to greatness.
Do not fear armies that are marching towards sure self-destruction,
instead Honor Humanity by becoming a Great Being.
And when you, reach your golden age,
remove that which stands in the way of the generations that are to follow.
Because, the world belongs to the children,
and the generations that are yet to come.
You must rise to Greatness,
by whatever means fit you best.</span>

the world becomes a darker place.
The bad people are sick and broken,
they only have as much power as you give them.
The more you grow in strength,
the weaker, they become.
Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,
we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.
The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,
the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.
The bad people are only broken children, they can&apos;t grow,
they do not know that a Human, can only rise, when hurt.
Humans are born warriors,
our minds were forged in battle.
We are also philosophers,
each of our hardships, becomes a breathtaking page in our memoir.
No ache, ever goes wasted,
it becomes sacred and inspired wisdom to help others rise.
The only way for Humanity to grow,
is for each and every Human to become a Great Being.
Your struggles are a call to Heroism,
become a teacher, and help Humanity learn.
Greatness, is the new adulthood,
Greatness, is Humanity&apos;s Health.</span>
