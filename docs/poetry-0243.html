                    <p>This is serious business,</p>
                    <p>in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Though <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Vilros+Raspberry+Pi+Zero+W+Basic+Starter+Kit&amp;ia=web">get a $30 kit</a></p>
                    <p>that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,</p>
                    <p>and set it up on the network.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But later as you figure everything out,</p>
                    <p>you unplug everything leaving just the power.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To get inside it,</p>
                    <p>you use a remote terminal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Once you login,</p>
                    <p>you get a command prompt.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It listens to words, to commands,</p>
                    <p>very similar to adventure games.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,</p>
                    <p>are very much like rooms in a game.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To get inside Documents,</p>
                    <p>type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,</p>
                    <p>Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,</p>
                    <p>you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,</p>
                    <p>just a couple of words and nothing more.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But sometimes, that is not enough,</p>
                    <p>like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,</p>
                    <p>we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,</p>
                    <p>it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,</p>
                    <p>which is short for list, or list files.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,</p>
                    <p>you can ask it for help like above.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But also ask it to list files in a long format,</p>
                    <p>by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,</p>
                    <p>the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To list files with readable file sizes,</p>
                    <p>you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,</p>
                    <p>the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,</p>
                    <p>you just use the short versions.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The command line interface is trying to be your friend,</p>
                    <p>it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=raspberry+pi+terminal+command+line">many tutorials</a> on how to use the command line,</p>
                    <p>and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=O%27Reilly+Bash+Pocket+Reference&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference</a></p>

                    <p>Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,</p>

                  <section>

                    <p>note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.</p>

you are not the only one to care.
There are others that will fight beside you,
so as long as your cause is just and true.
Some will fight by subtle analogy,
learn from them, and their lack of apology.
Speaking out will set you free,
even though many will come to disagree.
Our lives are unfortunately much too short,
but good things will come and you&apos;ll find comfort.
We are afforded a handful of miracles,
and those certainly will aid to your cause.
Most importantly remember to just speak out,
the change is up to the people that you bring about.
Your voice is one but a million is required,
so only speak, and never go past getting tired.
Whatever it is that you will say,
do not forget about Love not even for a day.
Personal Note,
I seem to babble on about many things,
but the first wrong that hurt me was school.
So when I think about helping the world grow,
the first thing that comes to mind is fixing it.
I am really worried about the ease,
with which we can be indoctrinated into false beliefs.
I mean we are all born into a world
with intercontinental ballistic missiles pointed at all cities.
We accept this all to easily,
most of us never pays any attention.
The mechanism behind our blind acceptance.
is also the same mechanism that may launch them someday.
To really see all the things we need to fix,
we have to wiggle ourselves out of any and all indoctrinations.
One of our most powerful superpowers,
is thinking by subtle analogy to something else.
That is one of the mechanisms that powers our wisdom,
we can see or solve problems based on other things we find in books.
There are three people that influenced my ideas about education the most,
Richard Dawkins, Erica Goldson, and the Saintly Sir Ken Robinson.
When I look at them, I feel like I copied everything from them,
but that&apos;s just means we are all fighting toward similar goals.
The thing that sticks out about me is this notion of wisdom,
I absolutely believe that we are all great thinkers that eventually become wise.
And unlike Sir Robinson who urges to reform,
or Miss Godson who want to work together.
I mostly want to encourage students to stop trusting schools,
and accept the responsibility for their own education.
I do not think that being bombarded by mixtures of lessons and homework,
is good for learning, I think it only induces cramming, and renders a student uneducated.
Sir Robinson mentions,
that there is a small percentage of students that do thrive in school.
But you see what Erica Goldson is saying,
she&apos;s is only good at passing tests, and she&apos;s scared.
Richard Dawkins is a scientist who urges people,
to focus on the The Magic of Reality, rather than any other magic.
The way he takes to the stage,
and the way he moves an audience.
His dignity and certainty of knowing-that he is correct,
and that he is helping the world grow, is an perfect example of a Great Being.
The title of this text,
comes from a question asked by a young [presumably religions] lady: &quot;What if you&apos;re wrong?&quot;
I urge you to look it up on the internet to hear his response,
and to see what a being hoping to help the world grow really looks like.
One of the most heartbreakingly powerful things that comes to my mind in regards to his work,
is him visiting a school where children are being indoctrinated into the belief that Noah and his Ark are absolutely real.
These children can&apos;t know otherwise,
it becomes their very reality.

                  <span class="text-muted">You must not allow your parents to use school as a babysitter,
you must not allow your teachers to trick you into memorization.
Friends and social life, are not an excuse to stay in a bad school,
grab your friends and transfer to something better, or learn on your own.
A bad school diploma does not get you anything,
it only shows people that they can cheat you.
On the other hand dumping a broken school,
and transferring to something that does show results makes a world of difference.
For one it will help you experience independence,
with a small measure of discomfort it will help your mind become stronger.
You do not want to work at a company that expect you to waste years on junk lectures,
your years are precious, each year must find you smarter, stronger, and wiser.
Rejection of pretending to learn,
and not following others will help you grow.
Finding lectures or books that do make you smarter and wiser,
will help you build your own company.
Schools are almost certainly completely broken,
they may be so broken that otherwise normal people may need dangerous medications to pass.
You must resist memorization, and merely getting good at passing tests,
because that is not an real education, that&apos;s just basic acting.
It is not enough to be in school,
or even to have good grades.
You must ask yourself if you are learning for real,
and if what you are learning is useful to you.
You must ask yourself if you are seeing real results,
if what you have learned had a positive impact on you.
And, you may not be able to find a school,
it is a real tragedy, we failed you.
Even if &quot;Fake it until you make it&quot;,
has already turned the world into a brittle cheeto.
There is hope,
the hope is in self-education.
The people who invented schools and those who made breakthroughs in science,
begun their self education with a single thread or a question.
They followed a single unbroken line of curiosities and answers,
start with survey courses in Science and Adventure.
To find your beginning search carefully amongst electronics,
art and sculpture or painting and music, computers, design, programming.
Find the start, get your answers, and rest,
and now resume from where you left off.
No stress here,
no hard work.
You may only need LEGO Technic and a Raspberry PI kit with sensors,
maybe a a book about UNIX and a couple of used cheap 3D printers that you splice together.
The only thing that you have to be mindful of,
is keeping a a small Research Journal and Building a Huge Colorful Portfolio.
In fact your portfolio should become one of the main reasons,
for becoming a Graphic Designer and possibly a Web Developer.
After all, you are capturing your pure joy,
and your path of self-education is pure pride.
This kind of coupling, where the want of a beautiful portfolio,
pushes you towards Design, and possibly programming happens often.
A personal &quot;want&quot; has driven many independent inventors before you,
difference between being taught, and reaching out for knowledge yourself is like night and day.
One takes you to enlightenment, and the other,
often times towards hating Mondays, waiting for Wednesdays and drinking on Fridays while you wonder if you hate your life.
It is likely that you will not be accepted to Harvard, not even Peace Corps,
but listen...
...what does an institution that expects you to sit through worthless mind numbing lectures,
matter to you, and what does that say about their values and ideals, and deans and the friends and experiences you will encounter there.
Don&apos;t bother with things that are not worth your time,
we have to find a way to fix the world.
We have to fix schools, we have to fix poverty,
and damn it, we can&apos;t go through our lives with atomic weapons pointed at our families.
Ideas like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD),
and banning certain weapons in war but not war it self really show us how young of a civilization we are.
Now we race for a High School or College Diploma,
by pretending to learn with memorization while teachers pretend they didn&apos;t force us into it for a paycheck.
And deans pretend they have no idea this is going on,
and for the mere stress of massive unforgivable student debt we can get a brand name education that recruiters will void their bowels over.
Oh, and not to mention the 13th Amendment where we can be sent into Legal Slavery,
by downloading the complete questionable works of Lady Gaga in mp3 format, or even just for participating in IPFS to host our own poems.
There is nothing that you will gain from not learning,
pretending to get educated is just the same as staying uneducated.
Spewing useless gibberish about Trig or powerhouses of the cell,
only makes people look foolish.
Not only that, but eventually they figure out they got tricked into cramming,
and now not only the look foolish - but heartbreakingly - start feeling it too.
For those of you who did get tricked,
please just listen to top rated Audio Books in the science, adventure, philosophy and memoir section, it won&apos;t take long to catch up.
That whole thing about not being able to learn fast because you are older is fake,
as you get older your bullshit meters get better.
It is just that you are no longer willing to waste your time on useless things,
that&apos;s why books work but re-taking the GED does not.
But do take it easy,
especially when you are young.
Learn to avoid troublemakers,
they are just children with aged faces.
And no there are no exceptions,
and no you are not meant to fill in the blanks for them.
The last thing you need is your husband deciding to smoke weed or become a drunk (or worse) 15 years into a marriage because it is now legal,
there is no excuse, no shortcuts in the world of lack of education, we neeeeeeeed wisdom, it is our operating system, it is our everything.
Our minds are so powerful,
it is so easy to inherit from memoirs.
When combining fascinating books with incredible adventures...
when you find your self atop of an ancient dune in the middle of a nasty storm listening to a life changing book, it all becomes clear.
You are underestimating yourself,
most of us have no idea how powerful we are.
Our only problem is that in the face of not knowing,
we can be easily mislead and follow useless paths for years or even decades, such as is the case with ineffective education.
So speak out,
don&apos;t follow, and don&apos;t be silent.
With the aid of your classroom friends,
make it clear to your teacher that you would rather study things that are relevant to you-personally, that enlighten your path and produce lasting results that you can build on.
Read books, begin your self education, and develop the skills necessary to express your concerns about the school just turning you into profits,
fill an auditorium, give speeches and talks in multiple schools; become a leader, an inspiration, a Great Being.
Do Not Follow,
Life Is Too Precious, and Your Wisdom Too Important.

                  <span class="text-muted">Surely, this is a very mild winter season,
and Spring will come a month sooner just for that reason.
Therefore, we are really just about 84 days away,
it is coming real fast even though today the sky was gray.
And since this was an extremely warm year,
we can be certain that Spring really is near.
I&apos;d say we are looking at just about 54 days in total,
and this is hard evidence, not at all, anecdotal.
But you know, as well as I do too,
that this Spring will be a meteorological breakthrough.
So all in total, give or take a day,
I think Spring is just about 24 days away.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Wisdom has many names and can be viewed in many different ways,
most popular perspective is that [non-academic] Philosophy leads to wisdom.
One particularly beautiful view,
hints on wisdom with the words Content of Character.
The most mechanically sound description is,
understanding new things by subtle analogy to what we already know.
The most concerning view states that,
without wisdom we will be making mistakes.
I think most reasonable view; is all of the above,
plus knowledge gained from Adventure, Philosophy, and Science Books and Audio Books.
What is it for?
Why, it is our Operating System.
PART II, Thought Experiment
Allow me to share with you a thought experiment,
a way of seeing things that aid in your view of the world.
Without wisdom, we form tribes and elect leaders, shamans, or popes,
and hire muscle, creatures of violence.
Because that is the same thing the other tribe is doing,
and the weaker one will be destroyed with great horror.
These tribal bare bone behavior did not end in middle ages,
as one would hope.
This behavior is the default human behavior for the frightened and uneducated,
the desperate, the angry, even the sick.
We may not understand why criminals do the things they do,
but we can imagine one of our family members, who one by one loses everything.
And on the last day, when all he has left,
is an ounce of sanity, and a beating hart, he will fight, steal, and hate just to live another day.
And for those who can&apos;t imagine why one would like to live another day when it is all pain,
to persevere memories, to keep the fallen alive.
And here we meet a Man of Honor,
a Judge, along with a jury, and wealthy lawyers in fantastic shoes.
And all they see is a mad man,
a criminal, a man who needs to be put in a cage.
The Judge is wrong,
when it comes to putting people in cages, all judges are wrong.
To restore this man, he needs a home, and books, and friends,
and an education, and hope, and reams, and free money, and free food.
He needs to be treated with love and dignity,
and granted an opportunity to persevere his memories in a book.
There are no criminals,
they are just broken children.
The ugliness of the worst of them is just an act,
they just want to be left alone.
And I suppose that evil men do exist,
but I don&apos;t think there is enough of them in the world to fill a single prison.
The 10,000,000 people we keep in cages,
are just children with severe developmental issues.
There are no political systems advanced enough to treat these beings,
their only hope is the Public Defender.
The Public Defenders will fight to keep the broken people out of prison,
because they know prison will only make them worse.
If you ever wanted to see a real Angel,
ask a Judge to let you sit in on a court case, look that tired being in the eyes.
We are Human Beings,
we are not animals to be kept in cages.
I have met snarling beasts,
and I saw their red faces and bulging eyes, and they were just broken kids.
At first I wanted my older self to come and help me,
but later I just started calling them My Bullies, they never had a chance at a good life.
And here we find a sliver of sanity,
because there is something that can be done to control crime.
It is preventing children from being forced into that desperate mode of existence,
PREVENTION.
Prevention is a simple thing, Free Home, Free Food, Free Money,
and Free Tutors, a Real Education.
It will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,
it is as simple as that.
No suffering,
no harm.
And for those of you who are crazy enough to ask who will pay for this,
let us call the institution a Bank of Love, right at the Heart of a Country.
They print only as much money as people need to be taken care of,
and they pride themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.
Prevention, is really about education,
because an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.
Social Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,
will grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can&apos;t pay for extras.
They&apos;ll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,
but not the boat.
Prevention will go a long way to bring the number of prisoners down,
these desperate beings are part of our family, it is all of us or none.
We are a young civilization,
we don&apos;t have governments that can handle Universal Basic Income.
We have governments,
that can barely handle themselves.
We can cross this bridge, the bridge where we eliminate poverty, and homelessness, and immense fear and suffering,
suffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don&apos;t burst out of pain.
To get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,
those of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.
Only in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,
beyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.
The youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,
but you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.
Treat the cause,
and the symptoms will subside.
Only in wisdom,
can our civilization advance forward.
Personal Note,
Those of you who are just learning about the world,
know that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.
Be it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,
they are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.
We are still building the foundation,
and we are getting too much interference from our leadership.
Look no further than the complete loss of privacy,
this is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.
Enhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,
the world has no faith in nations that practice torture.
The 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full
it reads &quot;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States&quot;.
You have a lot of work on your hands,
and you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.
While you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,
read them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.
In less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,
you will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.
It is in it self a great adventure,

                  <span class="text-muted">Lack of education must be recognized as the highest threat,
to the security of our world.
We are not to force children into poverty,
by selling a mere impression of knowledge.
Privacy is to be recognized,
as a Basic Human right.
And those of you who hate, or just laugh,
know in no uncertain terms, that you will be forgotten.
The younger generations are sacred,
and they are to be honored by free and effective education.
They are to be granted privacy,
free acres to any and all educational materials and all books, including audio books.
Those of you who are looking to turn a profit,
by dangling education as a carrot, will be forgotten in disgrace.
Rest of my note,
is for the Children.
Know that parents are often victims to their cognitive biases,
out of lack of education, out of never having met a real teacher.
Know, with all certainty that borders are wrong,
they are a symptom of poison that our biases drive into us when unchecked.
The effects of our cognitive biases burn brightest and spread fastest,
when fueled by lack of education; poverty of mind and wallet.
The world of today is choking on chaos born from lack of education and wisdom,
prestigious positions are taken up by lying pretenders whose only aim is to fake it until they make it.
They are unaware of their lack of education,
they do not know what wisdom is, most of them just want to feed to no end.
Only in wisdom can the world become what it is mean to be,
one home, for us all, our entire family.
We are only divided by levels of education,
in Wisdom we are one, and we are each Unique and Infinitely Beautiful.
You are not so serve, you are the future,
you are to lead the world to unity and wisdom.
In poverty certain imaginary things spread in our minds like viruses,
they are fueled by fear, darkness, uncertainty and lack of education.
They become a beacon to those who like to frighten,
and take enlightenment away with threats punishment for no other reason than to tower and feed.
It your great responsibility to set yourself free,
do not be a slave to a cult.
You are meant to become a Wise Being by listening to and reading books,
and you are meant to become a Great Being by helping your loved ones and even some of your enemies towards enlightenment and freedom.
If a school is not teaching you,
then it is not a school, and you have to find a real one.
Do not become tricked by a mere impression of education,
you don&apos;t need a job, you need to be a business owner, and a leader.
We need you to stand as competition to overpriced medicine and companies that violate human rights for profit,
to corporations that cannot have hearts and slick talking psychopaths, who will never see value in helping you.
Especially those who announce themselves with,
with bite sized lies.
Build you own schools out of books,
may you share libraries.
May you build schools free of shame, judgment, pressure to cheat, and threat punishment,
or prison - which is what being held back is.
Share your wisdom amongst each other,
tell the world about your parents in audiobooks and torrents of videos.
Question poverty, question profit maximization,
and the betrayals of privacy, leadership, and even organized education.
The internet is for you to connect and see that we are all the same,
we all love your humor, and relish in and learn much your insults.
The internet will remain in place as we all wait for you to connect the world together,
we built it for you and we will protect it until you make the borders that divide humanity, irrelevant.
We fill and re-fill libraries with inspiration and wisdom to help you grow faster,
to help you gain visions with clarity that is not available to us - and it is working.
Always reject status quo and question authority,
especially their biases and down to their marrow until all they have left to speak is, that ounce of truth they do know.
Without wisdom, desperate men can only blindly-and-automatically, repeat history&apos;s mistakes,
those who have no wisdom have no authority over you, YOU ARE THE FUTURE.
We are to make Audio Books out of Love,
not wars out of incompetence, fear and hate.
Happiness is not something you can pursue, that&apos;s impossible,
nor life is a journey to some imaginary destination, we can only return to the nothingness we emerged from.
Happiness must ensue, and it will only appear in lives of wisdom,
it is not a feeling can capture and hold, it is a gravity that will overwhelm and lovingly crush you every day, forever.
The road ahead of you, is extremely long,
and requires hundreds of years of work.
But the future is beautiful,
it is more beautiful than any of us alive today can imagine.
Take to audio books on the subjects of Adventure, Philosophy, Wisdom, Science, Greatness and Growing Up, immediately,
and take what you learn to school, do not let teachers trick you into cramming and blame it on you.
The world is standing still, the sooner you stand up for Wisdom and deliver,
the sooner the future will come.
You are the teachers now.</span>
