                    <p>This is serious business,</p>
                    <p>in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Though <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Vilros+Raspberry+Pi+Zero+W+Basic+Starter+Kit&amp;ia=web">get a $30 kit</a></p>
                    <p>that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,</p>
                    <p>and set it up on the network.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But later as you figure everything out,</p>
                    <p>you unplug everything leaving just the power.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To get inside it,</p>
                    <p>you use a remote terminal.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Once you login,</p>
                    <p>you get a command prompt.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>It listens to words, to commands,</p>
                    <p>very similar to adventure games.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,</p>
                    <p>are very much like rooms in a game.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To get inside Documents,</p>
                    <p>type in &quot;cd Documents&quot;</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The command &quot;cd&quot; is short for,</p>
                    <p>Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>When you say &quot;cd Documents&quot;,</p>
                    <p>you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,</p>
                    <p>just a couple of words and nothing more.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But sometimes, that is not enough,</p>
                    <p>like for example when you want to ask &quot;cd&quot; for help.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>We can&apos;t say &quot;cd help&quot; becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,</p>
                    <p>we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>You can type in &quot;cd --help&quot;,</p>
                    <p>it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To see what is in a directory, type in &quot;ls&quot;,</p>
                    <p>which is short for list, or list files.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>&quot;ls&quot; also accepts special inputs,</p>
                    <p>you can ask it for help like above.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>But also ask it to list files in a long format,</p>
                    <p>by saying &quot;ls -l&quot; here we use a singe hyphen, because &quot;-l&quot; is commonly used,</p>
                    <p>the -l is short for &quot;--long-listing&quot;, but nobody bothers spelling that out.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>To list files with readable file sizes,</p>
                    <p>you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as &quot;--human-readable&quot;</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,</p>
                    <p>the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,</p>
                    <p>you just use the short versions.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>The command line interface is trying to be your friend,</p>
                    <p>it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.</p>
                  </section>
                  <section>
                    <p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=raspberry+pi+terminal+command+line">many tutorials</a> on how to use the command line,</p>
                    <p>and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=O%27Reilly+Bash+Pocket+Reference&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">O&apos;Reilly Bash Pocket Reference</a></p>

                    <p>Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,</p>

                  <section>

                    <p>note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">We can&apos;t have a standardized education,
because that would require a standardized life.
A life in which we are only passionate about
what we are told to be passionate about.
A life where memorization,
does suffice.
My friends, the standardization of your existence,
is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.
A standardized existence is one
where your mind is taken from you.
Just like you recoil at the thought of a standardized breakfast,
the words standardized education should make you feel sick!
Even if you could learn by being taught like a little bird is fed,
how could you allow someone to pick the knowledge for your mind?
Allowing someone to insert standardized lessons into your mind is disgusting,
you are a unique and sacred being, born a genius and meant to be driven to wisdom and greatness.
You are meant to be the hope and dreams of all the past generations,
school, job, career, retirement and some promise of world travel is not how real life works.
The people in charge of creating early schools might not have had the opportunity
to create schools that are capable of inspiring the students to great heights.
Since, we have only updated that imperfect first attempt at mass education,
we lost the original dream of helping the world become Knowledgeable and Wise.
Today, teachers create cookie cutter lessons and matching tests,
that they expect you to cram for, in what has now become a Mockery of Real Education.
Standardization is evil and dangerous, it shows a total misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
it is a dangerous waste of time, that often destroys joy, uniqueness, talent, and other colorful predispositions.
Teachers can only help students to books,
they need to focus on creating and recording quality video lectures.
The greatest education that can be given to student is one afforded by student exchange programs,
beyond that it must be a path they pick; by choosing the materials that interest them.
A standardized education does not have enough depth to help the student grow,
it can only slow them down and restrict them.
An ordinary teacher is one, even a classroom and school is one,
and cannot reach a unique student in a way that they are ready for.
But copies of video lectures, audio books, interactive games, and books,
can! reach every student, and just at the right place in their development.
The world is changing at an increasingly faster pace,
the brittle ideas behind original standardized education never quite lived up to their promise.
Let us work towards replacing standardized education
with life-long personalized education.
Education that drives a student to Authenticity, Knowledge, Independence, Entrepreneurship, and Wisdom,
and not the curse of an uninspired existence born of broken promises, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and depression.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We all start with a Great Dignity, and Great Nobility,
we are full of genius and imagination, and impossible dreams.
We have to take good care for that,
and use our Dignity and Nobility to transcend all limits, and beyond.
There is a very tiny probability,
that we maybe all the intelligence and impossible dreams that the universe has ever seen.
Either way, we are royals, we are special and beyond impossible,
our ability to learn, to out-learn, to out-think, to abstract, is infinite.
We created these little schools that double as babysitters, and distractions,
but we need to make them second to our real education.
And our real education comes from about a thousand books we pick on our own,
and listen and read to throughout our entire life, noting must interfere with that.
You just need to take one step to get the taste for wisdom,
listen to top ten adventure and travel and or hiking or jogging audio books.
The way your spirit grows from taking part in other peoples adventure,
will show you, by subtle analogy, what the countless other steps will help you become.
A wise and great being, adventurer, some kind of an amazing genius,
and a beacon of hope, and light of inspiration, and love.
The lessons you choose with your own heart and mind,
are far more important than the lessons others are trying to make you cram for.
Books will grant you wisdom that will help you avoid regrets,
they will enhance your decision making and long term visions.
Books belong to you,
their wisdom is your intellectual inheritance.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Without reading powerful books written by wise beings,
all we can really do is come up with half-baked conspiracy theories.
Does High School work?
or does it destroy creativity, uniqueness, and self esteem.
Does college work?
Or is everyone participating in a mutually beneficial dog an pony show?
Are we supposed to just get a job? or or build a career?
And what about Start-ups and Entrepreneurship and Invention?
These questions matter, if you are in highs school,
and high school isn&apos;t working, or working out...
Then what actually is going on,
is that you are falling behind on knowledge and wisdom.
It is not that high school becomes easy or irrelevant when it is ineffective,
but that all this knowledge that would give you more insight into the world, is stolen from you.
Without that empowering knowledge;
a good grasp on the human condition, a good intuition for liars, manipulators and cheaters.
Without being well grounded in reality, we&apos;ll be forced into desperation,
into confusion, and all to easily swayed from the paths that we want to walk on.
With a real education, you can operate an online business,
or write software, or become an art fanatic and illustrator without any upfront investment.
You gain so much support from what you can do,
that poverty ceases to be frightening, and you are allowed to develop further.
In school we face this notion of grades and GPA that somehow belittles us,
and then we are led through a standardized education under the banner of balance.
A musician has little interest in biology beyond what a pleasant to read book provides,
in the world of grades it can only distract and hurt, and interrupt their self education.
And yet it appears, that grades exist primarily for getting more funding,
and they are fake, vague, and likely artificially manipulated to show progress.
Participating in nonsense,
can only beget more nonsense.
It is exhausting to try to figure all this out.
But think of a religious college, that puts science second to their particular religion,
think of a diploma mill, and all the colleges that ended up losing accreditation for questionable practices.
Think about all the happy students, all the hard working teachers,
all the nice ladies that made little jokes and loved the students they worked with.
And consider this,
The most complex of lies exist not just simply for gains,
but also because it is highly impossible or cost prohibitive to prove wrong doing, and down right impossible to prove ill intent.
No university professor ever receives an email about now being able to pawn his loose-leaf &quot;books&quot; on the students,
no dean ever asks the professors to let the students cram so that the college can keep their averages high and their accreditation.
These things are implied, assumed, and above all,
part of the very foundation of a for-profit-non-profit that has lobbied not to forgive student loans due to bankruptcy.
There is only one way to answer these questions,
and that is to listen to and perhaps read five to fifteen books on each of these subjects.
We must not allow ourselves to be misled into a life of un-education, and desperation,
a school that can&apos;t provide results better, than you listening to a few dozen audio-books on some fantastic adventure, is worthless.
The first few years after school should be about us trying to build our own businesses,
to see is there is perhaps something better than being overworked for the rest of our lives.
Entrepreneurship is not something that we can memorize,
ideas behind our undertakings have to come from our hearts and souls.
We need a real education for it,
if school is not helping us to our independence, then we must switch to self education.
Years go by pretty quickly when we aren&apos;t progressing forward,
and life has a way of getting ahead of us and challenging us with complexity.
I can&apos;t tell you is schools work or not,
though I am certain that education is life long.
And I can&apos;t pick your books for you,
because only you know the questions that call to you.
But I know that books and especially narrated books and video lectures, that you arrange in a sequence that agrees with you,
and watch at the pace that works best for you, are a powerful way to gain knowledge and to step ever closer to wisdom, and without any distractions.
We owe it to ourselves to find books that help us away from mediocrity,
and help us inherit lifetimes of functional wisdom towards authenticity and independence.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">All that has ever gone wrong,
has gone wrong due to rejecting realities, and accepting, fantasies.
To deny truth, is to create a terrible fantasy,
and no human being should ever be committed to one - as life is far too precious.
Yes, fantasies in a sickly way are more comfortable,
than the authentic life that unfolds by rules independent from our wishes.
But rejecting pleasant fantasies is no different
than the rejection of drugs.
It is simply not who we are,
and not where healthy people wish to be, or can possibly grow.
It is not that the world is too difficult to grasp,
but that, too many people are suffering from lack of knowledge.
Knowledge is found in books, best experience in their audio form,
and on a pleasant and relaxing adventure.
Books whose authors are admired for their hard work, clarity of long therm vision,
intelligence, wisdom, and often a wonderful sense of humor.
Alas, far too many people take to relive their fears by,
by constructing a view of the world they can understand and control.
All fantasies will eventually call for reinforcement,
and as history shows, at any, and all cost.
Be it something as tiny as the number of likes on a social network,
as odd as the status that pointlessly-expensive-cars bring.
Or something as heartbreaking as political systems,
where fathers will easily send their children to kill each other in battle fields.
A fantasy will call for reinforcement,
to keep it going to make it last, and no price will ever be too big.
Reality, is much harsher and not as comfortable or easy to grasp,
will call for constant effort, hard earned foresight, real and lasting results to our endeavors, and authentic dignity.
In reality; color of skin, numbered of colored pieces of paper, or the colors of a flag,
do not define who is superior, and who is inferior, who is better and who is worse.
In fantasy, poverty and war, are facts of life,
in reality, Love, Health, and World Peace, are, the most beautiful rewards for the most difficult of achievements.
In fantasy we crated tens of thousands of gods and as many battles in their worship,
in reality we invent Flight, try to get to the Moon for no clear reason, and even fantasize about Interstellar Travel to cross the galaxy.
In reality there is no evil, just a steady and colorful progress forward, we build Nuclear Plants and not Nuclear Missiles,
in fantasy evil oozes from the cracks that mad men must keep patching to prevent their small minds from falling to a thousand pieces.
Fantasies spread with culture,
they quite imperceptibly trick us into thinking of ourselves as other than we really are.
For example, if you don&apos;t believe you can be a genius,
you will not be able to become one, you&apos;ll never aim for it.
The longer you delay, the more obstacles will arise in your path
if you don&apos;t believe you can cross that challenge, you won&apos;t even try.
If you grant others control over your time, or life,
you will only limit yourself and how far you can travel.
Your mind is powerful enough to host cities of thoughts and dreams of, any size,
the only limit to your intelligence is the ability to mistakenly stop your self by accepting some falsehood.
Love, genius, empathy, foresight and insight, and spirituality exist within us all,
but without knowledge and eventual wisdom they too are limited and fall short.
Yes, at first, the real world is unknown to us,
but it is not meant to frighten us into creating fantasies that we think we can grasp.
It simply requires that we listen to a hundred books,
take a moment to explore the world around us with our new found experience...
And then very slowly and very gently as our long lives unfold,
listen to, and read, just about nine hundred more as not to ever fall short, and always have a beautiful story to tell.
We are sure to become wise, with all the building blocks we gain from books,
and then, if should we wish, we can turn right around and create some new books for others to read, and grow up with.
Do not be scared my friends,
as scary as poverty is, its power flows precisely from lack of education, wisdom and above all foresight.
The more knowledgeable and wiser the world,
the more overwhelming the force to crush poverty.
Growing up to become knowledgeable and wise as opposed to merely age in some easy fantasy,
is critical for our mental health and well being.
A thousand books you can listen to while traveling worlds most beautiful hiking trails,
is hardly a challenge, it shouldn&apos;t even be seen as a inconvenience.
Inheriting real and functional knowledge, that has a powerful and lasting impact on our growing up,
that enriches and enhances our decision making bringing us clear visions and impossible dreams is a great reward.
Becoming broke, or homeless, never being able to get a job, and being seen as a waste of life,
is not something that can happen to a wise a beautiful person that rejects fantasies in search of truths.
And it is important to remember,
that we can&apos;t graduate a by cramming and temporary memorizing disconnected facts.
A fake education,
is a meaningless education.
Companies known for hiring such inauthentic individuals are full of life draining liars and pretenders and probably in high positions,
whatever they build cannot be built with vision and wisdom, it can only self destruct.
Once you become self educated,
you are granted the opportunity to build your own companies with foresight and invention.
My dear reader, I would bet building an open and grade-free school that actually educates its students will be high up on your to-do list.
Building companies only becomes stressful when you build them for their own sake due to lack of vision,
when you enter on the path towards wisdom, you won&apos;t merely aim to impress investors, you will move generations.
It is OK to blindly set off towards wisdom,
it is one of the few leaps of faith that are worth the while.
Whatever your aims, may you inspire countless dreamers to greatness,
and may you reject all fantasy, holding authenticity and wisdom as the highest of values.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We, or the younger generations may find ourselves in situations where life does not make sense,
where too many things are contradictory, ineffective, and too broken to be of any real use.
When we are children we are taught falsehoods,
indoctrinated into religions, made to think of politics as special, and schools as critical.
We have no chance to question anything,
we have no experience at all.
Religions, broken politics and ineffective schools feed on blind belief,
if we taught children the truth they would try to help the world grow.
Plus, it does not take very long before life gets real, with bullies, rockets, wars, or illnesses,
and when we are placed on an imaginary foundation, we can&apos;t quite fight all that back, not very effectively.
Educated or not, Human Beings are still very special, and will fight for what little they know,
it is a terrible tragedy when people fight for something imaginary, that in the end, means nothing.
Just out of respect for children, and for the future generations to whom this planet truly belongs to,
we must resist propagating fantasies and myths.
The governments are not external forces, and they are not fully functional,
they are made to be ran by the people of their nations, and depend on schools that produce real results.
We can&apos;t teach the younger generations that World Peace is a funny fantasy,
World Peace has been the next important step for a century now.
Levels of education, wisdom, and greatness all around the world, need to increase,
while schools do work to some degree, they mean little when compared to self education and real results.
It is cruel to teach children lessons that will frighten them with a world that does not make sense,
all-the-while real life is happening and they need real facts and not imaginary opinions and wishful thinking.
Worst of all, we propagate myths because it is easier to pass on a faerie tale,
than to read a thousand books about the world and growing up.
Let us all put an end to this cycle to strangeness,
let us all aim to become self educated with world&apos;s finest books and lectures, onward to becoming wise.
Let us inspire the younger generations with facts and not mere opinions,
and let us remind, that the world and the politics and schools that demand great repairs, all belongs to them.

until the world becomes wise.</span>
