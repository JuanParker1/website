          <p>There are tipping points in your intellectual development,<br>
            where you go from careful observation to certainty of knowing.</p>
          <p>You build one thing on top of the other,<br>
            it becomes your Temple of Knowledge.</p>
          <p>If you are correct about it all,<br>
            then the more you add the more you understand.</p><br>
          <p>To learn for real,<br>
            we need fascination.</p>
          <p>And we need freedom to move between curiosities,<br>
            and there are no divisions of subjects here.</p>
          <p>We may learn numbers from calculating how many potential exoplanets our radio signals reached,<br>
            or we may trade mathematical notation for computer programming-languages where we can bring numbers to life.</p>
          <p>Then quickly leap to Astrophotography, and learn about Biology from books written by Astrobiologists,<br>
            Enlightenment is not just about what we target precisely, but also what we learn along the way.</p><br>
          <p>Enlightenment is Life, it is going round and round, and higher and higher,<br>
            through all these tiny twisty passages of Curiosity and Fascination to Discover more and more Light.</p>
          <p>There is no need to divide Enlightenment from Wisdom and Knowledge,<br>
            but we must make a strong division between Real Education that brings results,<br>
            and Fake Education that makes you unhappy, exhausted, stressed.</p>
          <p>Because unhappiness, exhaustion and stress,<br>
            will <strong>stop you</strong> from growing up, from becoming wise and enlightened,<br>
            from becoming an inspiration and helping the world grow a little.</p><br>
          <p>It is a scary thing to aim away from everything we&apos;ve been taught to want,<br>
            but you are you and not what someone tells you to be</p>
          <p>...and you are supposed to be much more courageous than merely taking your own path in life,<br>
            we can&apos;t live like quiet little mice just to be nice.</p>
          <p>We have too much imagination, too much passion and inspiration, foresight insight and vision,<br>
            we are not to live ordinary lives.</p><br>
          <p>We are Thinking Humans!<br>
            We are to live Lives of Inspired Enlightenment.</p>
          <p>Because that&apos;s what furthers Human Kind the most,<br>
            because that is part of what is <strong>best</strong> within us.</p>
          <p>Human Kind must grow in Wisdom and Enlightenment,<br>
            each of us is more than capable of becoming a Great Being.</p>
          <p>When we grow the Wold Grows With Us,<br>
            let us make this world a better place for us all.</p>
