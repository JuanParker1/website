          <p>My Friends, Build Your Mind,<br>
            Build Your Body.</p>
          <p>Do not ignore your well being,<br>
            you require Blue Skies, Seas, Mountains, Oceans, Lakes, and Forests.</p>
          <p>Do not ignore your Body,<br>
            it needs care and exercise, and proper diet.</p>
          <p>Do not merely hope to get a job,<br>
            make companies hope they can hire you.</p>
          <p>Do not ignore the Content of Your Character,<br>
            spend many great adventures in pursuit of wisdom and insight.</p>
          <p>Do not ignore Your Beautiful Heart,<br>
            keep rising, keep searching, keep shining.</p>
          <p>Build Your Life, like a Sculptor Builds a Sculpture.<br>
            Ensure Strength, Beauty, Authenticity, Dignity, Nobility, and Restraint.</p>
          <p>And when you run out of strength, and it will happen often,<br>
            laugh as you pick yourself up,<br>
            and your laughter will connect with the laughter of all the other Great Beings who rose before you.</p>
          <p>Your life, is to become a Work of Art,<br>
            day by day you must add to it, make it more beautiful.</p>
          <p>Our civilizations, cultures, and the world, may not be ready to embrace your growing up,<br>
            many will stand in your way, some even with advice that sounds good.</p>
          <p>Never follow,<br>
            Always lead.</p>
          <p>Know that all the steps you take toward wisdom and Enlightenment count,<br>
            and you will never regret this journey - as Rising Up, is a Law of the Universe.</p>
          <p>All the Great Beings who have risen before you,<br>
            had only one regret: &quot;I should have risen faster.&quot;</p>
          <p>So get up,<br>
            and Go!</p>
