        <p>You know me, I am not one to complain,<br>
          but; every once in a while a little bird flies into my jogging lane.</p>
        <p>She lands, and turns her head to look at me,<br>
          the moment she sees that I see...</p>
        <p>...she starts hopping, moving <strong>much</strong> faster than me,<br>
          at first I thought she was trying to raise me as her baby.</p>
        <p>But now I think she&apos;s only doing this, to mock me,<br>
          she&apos;s just sick of seeing me struggle from her tree.</p>
        <p>For one, when she&apos;s done racing me,<br>
          she stops and just stares angrily.</p>
        <p>Then she always takes off for my face,<br>
          it is really hard to duck when you are trying to focus on your pace.</p>
        <p>I have a theory as to why she flies at me this way,<br>
          though I am afraid to say,</p>
        <p>Umm...</p>
        <p>Some of the flies that catch me when I leave my yard,<br>
          you know, those little ones that are always trying to lick so hard.</p>
        <p>Even after several miles... they kind of keep my pace,<br>
          kind of actually run circles around my face.</p>
        <p>While, I bring most of the flies back,<br>
          the bird probably flies at me like this, to grab a snack.</p>
        <p>Well,</p>
        <p>I am now trying really hard to improve my pace,<br>
          to get all those creatures out of my face.</p>
        <p>I run fast just as soon as I get out of my home.<br>
          maybe if I can outrun the flies the bird will leave me alone.</p>
