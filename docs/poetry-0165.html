          <p>Nothing was coincidental,<br>
            it was strong and clear.</p>
          <p>The amateurs were the first,<br>
            social networks came to a crawl.</p>
          <p>The signal originated nowhere other,<br>
            than the uninhabitable Proxima Centauri b.</p>
          <p>There was an orbiting computer,<br>
            they are spaced out 100 light years apart.</p><br>
          <p>Frank Drake was looking at the bitmaps,<br>
            with the candles on his birthday cake still lit.</p>
          <p>He saw a machine, like in the movie,<br>
            &quot;prank&quot; he said with a broken heart.</p><br>
          <p>Ms. Tarter said,<br>
            &quot;This is not a prank&quot;.</p>
          <p>She pointed to the pictorial with familiar animals,<br>
            and then the undeniable images of poverty came.</p>
          <p>Seth had it all figured out for years, he growled &quot;These are diagrams for a Planet Wide Governing Body&quot;<br>
            &quot;for a Peaceful, Wise, Planet Wide Government&quot;, he said with tears with his eyes.</p><br>
          <p>No Poverty</p>
          <p>No War</p>
          <p>No Weapons Manufacturing</p>
          <p>No Weapon Stockpiles</p>
          <p>No Prisons, No Punishement (Only Hospitals and Therapy)</p>
          <p>No Hurting or Eating Other Species</p>
          <p>A Planet United Under A Single Government</p>
          <p>No Representatives, No Presidents, No Political Personalities</p>
          <p>Humanity Comes Together To Vote On Good Ideas, One Idea At A Time.</p>
          <p>(The plans revealed how the ideas are protected, only questionnaires are answered.)</p>
          <p>The ultimate goal of the Planetary Government is to Converge on Wisdom.
            It is to protect the planet from self destruction, and encourage growth of Wisdom and Technology.</p><br>
          <p>The leading theory is that is is an early radio satellite,<br>
            that it maybe automated, like a network of chat-bot drones.</p>
          <p>Withing 50 years an upgrade arrived,<br>
            it had just one more pictorial.</p>
          <p>It showed that Milky Way was teeming with life,<br>
            there are billions of mutually incompatible ecosystems with intelligent life,<br>
            and billions more without.</p>
          <p>There is no safe way to travel,<br>
            there is no safe way to enter the ecosystems.</p>
          <p>Their technology is the same as ours,<br>
            soldering irons and radio signals.</p>
          <p>That&apos;s all there is,<br>
            that&apos;s all there ever will be.</p>
          <p>It showed that life was seeded by the first planet,<br>
            it was a crudely and hastily engineered extremely adaptive extremophile.</p>
          <p>The dying planet sent out microscopic capsules moving at relativistic speeds,<br>
            the estimates are 75,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons of capsules were sent.</p>
          <p>The time dilation made the universe age faster,<br>
            or relatively speaking slowed the decay of the extremophiles.</p>
          <p>Life is everywhere,<br>
            it is as old as the universe, everywhere, and eveywhen.</p>
          <p>The old probe was sent out way and intercepted in the earth orbit,<br>
            it contained some of the original capsules for study and as proof.</p>
          <p>We made many copies of the broadcasting station and sent them into orbits of all the nearby exoplanets,<br>
            the plans and pictorials for the planetary government remained unchanged.</p>
          <p>We reproduced the capsules as well it was primitive engineering,<br>
            scientists are against it, but in theory it is a safe mechanism to aim at Andromeda and the Magellanic Clouds.</p><br>
          <p>A Circular Symbol was translated to be the shape that represents our union,<br>
            we were able to translate the surrounding glyphs.</p>
          <p>In Wisdom,<br>
            We Are One,<br>
            All Around.</p>
