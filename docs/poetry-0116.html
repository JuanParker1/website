        <p>Try to imagine yourself born in different places or to different cultures,<br>
          note how you are influenced by all the surrounding factors.</p>
        <p>Note, how there are parts of you that never do change,<br>
          that form some kind of a foundation.</p>
        <p>Rather, than than letting your place of birth or culture influence you,<br>
          imagine inventing yourself <strong>independently</strong> of everything.</p><br>
        <p>Look towards Nonfiction Books or Audiobooks, Memoirs and Biographies,<br>
          and see what wisdom you can inherit to help you on your own journey forward.</p>
        <p>Allow those parts of you that never seem to change no matter what culture you are born into,<br>
          to expand, and grow upwards.</p><br>
        <p>See if becoming a Citizen of The World,<br>
          and not any nation in particular, helps you see the World more clearly.</p>
        <p>See if becoming a Lover of all Wisdom, and All Good Ideas,<br>
          and not merely the culture you were born into, helps you understand more about the Human Condition.</p>
        <p>Imagine that you are Made of Stars,<br>
          that you are a Child of the Universe.</p>
