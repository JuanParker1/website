                    <p>Bruce Lee, was the first Ultra that I have heard of. Ultras are folks like
                      you and I that train to jump a little seedling of corn. Day by day,
                      GRADUALLY, the little corn grows a little bit taller, and the little ultra
                      strives to jump a little bit higher.</p>
                    <p>In modern times the C25K comes to mind, meet <a href="http://carlifierce.com/10-k-downloads/">Fierce Carli</a> Just from
                      plain experience with jogging we can guesstimate that by GRADUALLY
                      increasing the length of distance, we will gain the endurance to run
                      hundreds of miles.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Dean Karnazes, mentions Lactic Acid build up. I think of it as mostly
                      nonsense, where does the lactic acid go when your performance increases
                      from long distance running? Your first mile the first time you run will
                      burn, but the 10,000th time you will feel elation. Genetics are a myth.</p>
                    <p>Here is Dean&#x2019;s book, it is a good read, and a good Audiobook. It contains
                      growing up, and adventures, and stories of triumph, and aches.

                      your 80 year old self, and make the wish Killgore Trout did: &#x201C;Make Me Young
                      Again&#x201D;, and open your eyes, and be young but wiser for it. Therein you will
                      discover the nature of the Ultra. While we live our only life, poetically
                      we live as it was countless lives already. By wiggling forward and back we
                      can see where we are headed, and end up where we always wished to be.</p>

                      <p><em>This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live
once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it,
but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh&#x2026; must return to
you&#x2014;all in the same succession and sequence&#x2014;even this spider and this
moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal
hourglass of existence is turned over again and again&#x2014;and you with it,
speck of dust!</em></p>
                      <p><em>Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon
who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you
would have answered him: &#x201C;You are a god, and never have I heard anything
more divine!&#x201D;</em></p>
                      <p><em>If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you
are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, &#x201C;do you
want this once more and innumerable times more?&#x201D; would lie upon your
actions as the greatest weight.</em></p>

                      <h2>Wisdom and Endurance</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>The workout is powered by the soul of a very old warrior, who lived many a
                      lifetime in daydreams, stories, books, and poems. There is no pain, it is
                      just a signal.</p>
                    <p>On the Mind part, focus on gaining wisdom by all means. On the body part,
                      keep extending your endurance, the pain is too primitive to catch up with
                      an ultra.</p>

And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished. The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen. We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses. Nietzsche Viktor Frankl State of Mind INVICTUS - W. E.

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
