                    <p>The adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each time someone loses belief in themselves,
the world becomes a darker place.
The bad people are sick and broken,
they only have as much power as you give them.
The more you grow in strength,
the weaker, they become.
Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,
we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.
The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,
the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.
The bad people are only broken children, they can&apos;t grow,
they do not know that a Human, can only rise, when hurt.
Humans are born warriors,
our minds were forged in battle.
We are also philosophers,
each of our hardships, becomes a breathtaking page in our memoir.
No ache, ever goes wasted,
it becomes sacred and inspired wisdom to help others rise.
The only way for Humanity to grow,
is for each and every Human to become a Great Being.
Your struggles are a call to Heroism,
become a teacher, and help Humanity learn.
Greatness, is the new adulthood,
Greatness, is Humanity&apos;s Health.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">When you think about life decade by decade,
you can see that it is best lived by following an upward slope.
Each decade should be powerful for us,
it should propel us forward and beyond.
We must really take the time to consider what is important,
what is it that our elder selves may regret not having done.
Life does come with an instruction manual,
it is all the Audio Books that will interest you.
From Memoirs, to Adventure, and Science,
and also reading in-between the lines.
Above all, we must take good care of ourselves,
life is not meant to be lived in stress, or fear, or at a great speed.
This is how we can understand those books,
and learn from them and inherit their wisdom.
We are each a miracle of the universe,
the GPA, the championship or scholarship, just does not matter.
Listen to those words,
IT DOES NOT MATTER!
Because you are already more,
than any of that made up stuff!
It is not the brand of education that matters,
what matters, is that your education, brought you wisdom!
With wisdom, if you still need to,
you will build your own Firm, or Company, or School.
Pursuit of Wisdom, guarantees that as each decade passes,
you will grow in Greatness.
With Wisdom, and the transcendence of limits it entails,
come our golden age, we will become far more, than we thought possible.
The most prestigious degree, is the honorary degree,
where a University goes out of its way to deliver it to you,
for all your achievements, and the goodness you brought to the World.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">You are more than a student, or employee,
you are more than what you have, and even more than your dreams.
But oh my gosh, it is so easy to forget how special we all are,
fall to daily routines, and carrots and sticks and stones.
Two weeks of vacation for a little adventure is not enough
to push stress back and remember how beautiful we all are.
We have to try very hard not to lose ourselves in work,
in stress, in deceptions, in toxic situations.
Listen, just because you CAN - if you go all out to get that promotion,
or GPA, or diploma, it does not mean you should.
Because, you MUST make room for Sunshine, and Starry Nights,
for little adventures allover the place, and then some.
Your well being is not to be sacrificed for any reason,
no matter who is telling you that you must, must, must!
No, just say no,
and go.
Go, on the worlds most perfect adventure,
one that lasts a long time, and starts with a tiny shopping expedition,
But also carries on for days, maybe weeks,
a visit to every antique store along the way to buy the cheapest but cutest thing.
So cute, that NOBODY will question you needing it,
but so CHEAP, that everyone will say &quot;Oh wow, it is already old!&quot;
And then make expeditions to get ice cream,
and sausages, and why not buy a White Chocolate Cookies And Creme candy bar, why not in deed.
And continue on, mounting expeditions for fossils, and minerals,
a lighthouse, a beach far and yonder, chipmunk photos, and firewood.
All the while, remembering, and sometimes discovering,
who you are, where you are headed in life, and what it will be like when you arrive.
I... like driving at night,
because it seems safer.
I pack my gear in the afternoon,
I make sure to have water and some canned goods.
I wait until early Monday morning,
2AM or so, connect my GPS and go.
It takes about 3.5 hours to get there,
I always listen to the The Four Horsemen Discussion couple of times.
I discovered the Ludington State Park,
by just following highways and big roads.
It is really easy to get there,
take I-275 North, and follow I-96 West they kind of connect with an arc.
Then after hours and hours,
then take exit 1B to merge onto US-31 North, that takes you to the city limits.
Then when you run out of road,
take a left on US-10 that will take you in to Ludington.
Please drive carefully,
try to bring many friends along.
I always arrive early,
so I take a small nap in the Meijer parking lot.
Upon my awakening I go get some Ice Cream,
and shop around for Fanny Packs.
And, I always make sure to have mosquito sticks,
the thick ones that you light on fire, watch for that ash if you try to move one.
You drive west through Ludington,
there is a huge parking lot and a beach like no other.
Please ignore the signs that say &quot;DO NOT FEED SEAGULLS&quot;,
they are starving and need all your breadcrumbs.
I always watch sunsets, but when I parked at that beach, got ready, and put my sunglasses on,
some cute couple started making fun of me for how seriously I take the whole ordeal.
Perhaps it is just better to keep slowly driving north,
towards the State Park.
I always do, my office is there, for one,
right on that little parking lot when the dunes start, it is, a good view.
I remember one time I caught a nap there too,
waking up to an endless horizon was quite an awakening, that for sure.
Well you know how it is, State Parks are not free,
and it is best to book a Jack Pine Hike-in Site ahead of time.
As you keep going north, you can pay on the left where the campers go,
or you can just keep going and pay by the gate.
Park, disembark, and get ready to haul everything to your hike-in site,
watch out for owls.
Once you are there, set up camp, get some squeaky water out of the pump,
and get all the firewood you can find.
I always bring a hand saw with me,
I don&apos;t mess around when it comes to firewood.
And then hop over the dune,
there is a paradise out there, and you have to build something out of the drift wood.
The little lighthouse in the distance,
that&apos;s the Big Sable Point Lighthouse.
They sometimes hire people to work in their gift-shop,
and apparently give them a little apartment up there; sounds lonely to me.
Every time you come back from a little adventure,
and see that &quot;JACK PINE CAMPGROUND HIKE-IN SITES&quot; sign, it will feel like coming back home.
Jack Pine is a wonderful place,
aim to stay there a month if you can.
Move from site to site,
stay a day at the State Park, shower and come back to Jack Pine until you had enough.
Finally, when it is time to leave Jack Pine,
grab a pine cone to remember it by, and head to Nordhouse, just for a day or two.
They have a metal box you slip a few dollars into to get a parking permit,
and you&apos;ll have to hike a bit to get to the Wideness area, but it will be worth it.
It is so beautiful, that you may wish to stay longer than a couple of days,
you can walk the woods via Arrowhead Trail, or take the beach.
Watch for breaks in the grass,
that usually means there is a neat campsite out there.
Jack Pine will always feel very welcoming,
Nordhouse is a bit wilder.
You will have sand in your gear, and car for months,
hopefully to last you a whole winter so that you may get a refill come spring.
I say the Nordhouse sand brings good luck, and good memories,
when you are stressed out in a hurry, and notice there is still some sand left...
It will put things in perspective,
take you back to your latest camping adventure for a moment, help you slow down.
And above all, remind you to tidy up your gear,
give that old tent a sniff and see if you need to order a new one.
Before you know it,
it will be ample time to head on out there again.
One of the healthiest things we can do,
is sync up with the sun... go to sleep at sundown and get up at sunrise.
Another is to always make sure,
we have plenty of room in our life to read or listen to books.
And most importantly, Nature,
the bird song,
the chipmunk squeaks,
the crisp air,
the rich woodland fragrance of moss, fern and bear,
the building of a fire,
swimming in the lake,
exploring ancient dunes,
aimlessly collecting fossils and cute pebbles by the beach,
watching a beautiful storm in the distance,
searching for arrowheads...
...suddenly popping into the nearby gas-station to get more ice cream and sausage,
and then getting back to the camp, for another long and starry evening,
and slowly falling asleep, just to wake up to a another healing day.
Never forget your dreams,
never forget who you are.
Never, overwork yourself,
just because you can it does not mean you should.
We are far too beautiful to treat ourselves cogs in a machine,
we are meant to grow, and bloom, and inspire, and move entire generations.
We are so good at learning, and understanding, and mastering knowledge,
that past a few books, the undiscovered country beacons.
We are a young civilization,
do not let that push you around.
You are to discover your path to becoming a Great Being,
and help the world grow in Wisdom and in Peace.

                  <span class="text-muted">Books and Audio Books,
are as important to us as food.
But many of us can&apos;t get into them,
and there is a reason why.
Many lives are lived at a speed,
that makes books hard to follow and understand.
We lead busy lives,
and majority of our time is spent in haste.
Haste brings us relief from,
anxieties and confusing questions.
Part of the reason why haste,
brings us relief.
Is that there is less time,
to be bothered with things we don&apos;t understand.
This is the reason why many people, come their golden age,
feel, that life was a lot shorter than they expected.
In a word, haste blocks us,
from experiencing our lives in full.
Books hold all the answers that will address anxiety and confusion,
but they require that the person exists the state of haste to understand them.
As we read, comprehend, and inherit more and more,
we&apos;ll hold enough answers to learn to live without the need for haste.
To slam the breaks,
we need a change of scenery.
Section hiking Appalachian, of the Pacific Crest Trail,
comes highly recommended by many great beings.
But any kind of long adventure,
where you have to go to sleep come sundown, will do.
Even before you decide where you are headed,
even before you get your backpack out.
You will be able to see,
how easy it will be to absorb your audio books as you walk through the woods.
Both your body and your mind,
will begin transforming.
What was once &quot;just moss&quot;,
will not become a precious sunlit dew world.
Fern will now paint the world around you, perfectly hiding beautiful secret springs,
little furry creatures, damn angry bears, and other woodland treasures.
At twilight you will have to go to sleep,
you&apos;ll awaken full of energy just before sunrise.
The scent of a green morning,
the sound of nature.
And then the books will start calling you,
maybe it will be &quot;A Walk In The Woods&quot; by Bill Bryson.
Or it could be &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;.
by Carl Sagan, or &quot;The Partly Cloudy Patriot&quot; read in Sarah Vowell&apos;s amazing voice.
It will be nice, and relaxing,
it will be impossible to put down.
And then,
something you didn&apos;t expect will happen.
See, whatever your next big step in your life,
that internal transformation that your soul is ready to leap to...
It has already been described,
with Love and Passion in a book somewhere.
Within the first ten books you are bound to find,
the first one that deeply will move you.
It will connect with you, extend you,
integrate with you, help you leap forward in your development.
Within days you won&apos;t even be able to remember,
what came from the book and what was already in you.
It will change everything,
it will restore you completely.
And so your search for the next life-chaining book,
and the next adventure, will begin.

                  <span class="text-muted">The only thing that divides Humanity,
is levels of education.
The more educated we become,
the closer we come together.
With real education,
comes wisdom.
Humanity is destined,
to come together in Wisdom and Peace.
To hasten our Convergence on Wisdom,
we must accept the responsibility for our own education.
We are each perfectly unique,
there is no such thing as a standard human mind.
We must choose our own books the books we enjoy,
and walk the path that fits us best book by book, at just the right pace.
A book is a stored wisdom,
where our body needs food our mind needs books.
Books accelerate our intellectual development,
books are inherited best when read by a fine narrator.
It will take a hundred books to find the ten we need,
and poetically speaking our mind will merge with their wisdom.
We will become wiser, more compassionate,
more authentic, stronger, calmer and more creative.
While looking at ourselves we see the common Humanity,
we are more than that.
When the younger generations look at us,
we are a call to Enlightenment, to Inspiration, and Knowledge and Wisdom.
Who we are,
is where all the world&apos;s children follow.
Let us delay no more,
and take to books right now.
Let us help those who have difficulty reading,
by helping them to narrated versions.
And let us not forget,
that Greatness calls to All Beings.
Therefore, let us all become Wise and Great,
so that the Younger Generations may follow.</span>
