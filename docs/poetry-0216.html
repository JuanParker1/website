                    <p>The adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">The best way to win against a liar, is to never meet one,
the simplest way to &quot;win&quot; is not to play their game.
This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,
liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.
One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,
they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn&apos;t cause much headache.
But it, looking like an expensive medicine, and costing like one,
when people felt it in their system, they automatically assumed it was working.
This is still going on, and when I was a teenager I actually bought a skin cleanser,
at a pharmacy, in the US, that in no uncertain terms, stated that this was homeopathic medicine,
Home and medicine, sounded good to me,
and it seemed to have been a gentle soap, but it was just the cheapest thing that they could possibly put in a tube.
I checked the top three pharmacies in the US in 2020, and heart-breakingly,
they all continue selling homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
Knowledge and Wisdom, and the path it entails,
is the most wonderful and safest way to avoid all this nonsense.
Because once you become more knowledgeable than the liar,
you will be able to hear them bending words, and twisting stories, the way your Mum was able to pick up on subtle cues when you were lying as a baby.
Now, past some point in an education, many, or perhaps most people, front healthy skepticism first,
not because they assume everyone is a liar, but because they wonder if someone might not have tricked themselves into a falsehood like I did with my homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.
More than that, when I was a teenager, and someone asked me if Mokele-mbembe existed,
I would whole heatedly, and with all the love in my heart, say:
&quot;I hope so, after all, it is not a question of their existence, is it now? They used to exist millions of years ago.
It is a question of whether or not there is one or two, left in Rhodesia.&quot; - with a heavy and hairy accent, whilst bouncing my unibrow up an down.
Anybody asking me about cryptozoology was better off,
fronting mountains of skepticism first - the brontosaurus was my favorite dinosaur!
And get this, Brontosaurus is no longer the same thunder lizard we are all familiar with,
it was a misclassification, the dinosaur that you think of as Brontosaurus is actually called Apatosaurus now.
In context of liars, which are pretty damn scary, and only get more frightening as they come together in groups,
...searching for forgiveness, reinforcement and easy pickings to whatever their disorder is; we need to take to knowledge and wisdom as soon as possible.
Middle school, is a pretty good time to start learning for real,
and start climbing over everyone&apos;s heads, to get ahead of things.
Books narrated by their authors,
are an especially precious gift of knowledge.
Bill Bryson has some nice and funny books that help people grow,
A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, and In a Sunburned Country, are beautiful.
But it is best that you start with what moves you,
look at various best seller lists, and keep an eye on non-fiction of you can.
And climb, keep searching for that next book that will agree with you,
and explore everything, explore the world, the trails, the libraries, all the places of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.
It does not take many books to get ahead of liars,
it only takes a few more to get ahead of those that don&apos;t know they are causing harm.
And here the handful of your beloved Memoirs, Biographies, and adventure books,
will transform, to your Sword and Shield, and you will fell many a monster and dragon, onward to a cheerful future.
Start learning on your own, not just to avoid liars and crappy people,
but to become you, the person that you are predisposed to be.
As you grow, there will be some mild regrets, but it is not going to be anything huge,
and whatever you do end up missing by taking your own less traveled road...
Use is as a compass, just because you missed something, it doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t find it again,
feeling like you missed something is a beautiful call to new adventure.
There is nothing to be scared of, by choosing the path of Knowledge, Wisdom, and maybe Greatness,
those are the very components by which humanity grows.
Our superpowers that grant us the abilities to prevent suffering.
making our pains count for more by fixing the problems that hurt us, and preventing others from falling into the same trap.

                  <span class="text-muted">The Universe works in very honest ways,
when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.
When we face impossible problems,
someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.
When governments become too complex,
the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.
When liars start winning all the battles,
your wisdom will become even more precious.
A senator&apos;s boy brought into positions of authority,
by means of favors, shortcuts, and being told what to say, can&apos;t become wise.
Wisdom grows from within our authenticity, dignity, and love,
from clarity of vision, and being moved by generations of giants.
Authenticity helps us up,
wisdom on top of wisdom, plateau by plateau onward to greatness.
Inauthenticity, can only build temporary things,
that soon collapse under their own weight for lack of foundation.
Just because you feel hopelessness,
when you dream about making the world a better place...
It does not mean you should stop loving, thinking, writing,
when the future comes asking: what is next?
Your books are to be complete, beloved, and held in high esteem,
your works must move the world.
All that is true, and worthy of human kind,
requires generations of work, same inspiration, same vision.
May your works serve as the first stepping stone,
a source of rules that will keep Humanity Safe and Sound.
May your works inspire countless generations,
across all the world&apos;s nations.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We have a tendency to take things for granted,
and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.
It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.
The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.
Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.
The world has also become more interconnected,
those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.
Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,
all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.
There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,
the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.
All the fantasies and walls will fade, today&apos;s problem with borders and cults,
is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,
to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.
We are infinite in our minds,
just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.
Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,
something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.
It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,
and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.
This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,
this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.
And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,
the sciences call to everyone.
Personalized education doesn&apos;t really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,
as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.
Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,
and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.
We don&apos;t learn the way schools teach,
we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.
By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,
problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.
A more knowledgeable world,
is a more capable world.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Each generation, including yours, Dear Reader,
is charged with figuring out, what is wrong.
Previous generations discovered many wrongs,
Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.
Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,
we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.
The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,
is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.
Liars everywhere, in the blindness caused by lack of education,
are easily out-competing generations of beings who dedicated their lives to the betterment of Human Kind.
Children are forced to memorize and pretend to learn to get good grades,
and hope to go to colleges and universities that hardly live up to their promises.
Their job search, and school loans,
the way they are treated from interview to retirement does not do them justice.
The younger generations are the Sacred Hope and Future of Human Hind,
but they are now exploited by old fat lice who cannot stop feeding even if their life depends on it.
The teachers in their haste to bring a little paycheck home have lost the respect for students,
professors now sell home-made textbooks as ineffective as their lectures, and universities.
The children can see all this,
they understand the minds of these failures.
They merely need to ask:
&quot;How would I have to think, and how low would I have to sink, to do as they do.&quot;
Humanity requires a real educational system to effectively pass knowledge between generations,
when we finally create it, we will see blind stupidity and all the evils it fuels, fade.
My friends, this is not a difficult project,
we come together to record video lectures, write and narrate books.
We pay,
for outstanding contributions and translations of these lectures.
That payment,
is the grade.
We create a massively multiplying and overlapping global educational system,
that has no structure, and countless redundant paths towards knowledge, excellence and wisdom.
Those paths,
are the diploma.
Companies that show compassion, worth and balance,
inspect these paths in search of talent.
Even so, students are encouraged to build multi-founder start-ups,
throughout the world and their lives.
This world school, is not an neat addition to this world,
this school: Becomes Our World.
It becomes our point of convergence on World Peace,
and the Library of Ideas worth keeping.
The fundamentally broken naysayers will come,
as the erosion of the good ideas and propagation of war, poverty, and all other bad ideas is their food.
But those who stand against Prosperity, Unity, Knowledge, Wisdom and World Peace,
are just an animated rotting corpse that needs to be left behind in the poverty and desperation they once exploited to their advantage.
For the sake of the future generations,
let us rise against evil and mediocrity.
May we abandon all that moves against the grain of reality,
and all that is fake, ineffective, and lacking positive, real, and permanent results.
Let us cradle the future generations in Knowledge, in Wisdom, and in Greatness,
and honor them and their challenges, with World Peace.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">We can&apos;t have a standardized education,
because that would require a standardized life.
A life in which we are only passionate about
what we are told to be passionate about.
A life, where memorization,
does suffice.
My friends, the standardization of your existence,
is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.
A standardized existence is one
where your mind is taken from you.
Just like you recoil at the thought of a standardized breakfast,
the words standardized education should make you feel sick!
Even if you could learn by being taught like a little bird is fed,
how could you allow someone to pick the knowledge for your mind?
Allowing someone to insert standardized lessons into your mind is disgusting,
you are a unique and sacred being, born a genius and meant to be driven to wisdom and greatness.
You are meant to be the hope and dreams of all the past generations,
school, job, career, retirement and some promise of world travel is not how real life works.
The people in charge of creating early schools might not have had the opportunity
to create schools that are capable of inspiring the students to great heights.
Since, we have only updated that imperfect first attempt at mass education,
we lost the original dream of helping the world become Knowledgeable and Wise.
Today, teachers create cookie cutter lessons and matching tests,
that they expect you to cram for, in what has now become a Mockery of Real Education.
Standardization is evil and dangerous, it shows a total misunderstanding of the Human Condition,
it is a dangerous waste of time, that often destroys joy, uniqueness, talent, and other colorful predispositions.
Teachers can only help students to books,
they need to focus on creating and recording quality video lectures.
The greatest education that can be given to student is one afforded by student exchange programs,
beyond that it must be a path they pick; by choosing the materials that interest them.
A standardized education does not have enough depth to help the student grow,
it can only slow them down and restrict them.
An ordinary teacher is one, even a classroom and school is one,
and cannot reach a unique student in a way that they are ready for.
But copies of video lectures, audio books, interactive games, and books,
can! reach every student, and just at the right place in their development.
The world is changing at an increasingly faster pace,
the brittle ideas behind original standardized education never quite lived up to their promise.
Let us work towards replacing standardized education
with life-long personalized education.
Education that drives a student to Authenticity, Knowledge, Independence, Entrepreneurship, and Wisdom,
and not the curse of an uninspired existence born of broken promises, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and depression.</span>
