                      <h2>Poverty Of Mind Comes From Lack Of Non Cognitive Skills</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Dan Cardinali&apos;s definition of Non Cognitive Skills includes the following:
                      Building grit, and resilience, and persistence, and self-regulation. He&apos;s
                      describing skills of a Warrior, a Fighter, an Authentic Grown Up.</p>
                    <p>Dan Cardinali explains that ideally families should provide Non Cognitive
                      Skills (Child Development), and then schools will deliver Academic
                      Development (Math, History, Physics).</p>
                    <p>But this is not how it works today, well to do parents are too busy,
                      parents stricken by poverty can&apos;t have time, and non-cognitive skill
                      development is not only unavailable, but is often laughed at by teachers
                      &quot;Parents do your job.&quot; they brainlessly utter.</p>
                    <p>Above all, a child born to the culture of poverty (lacking non-cognitive
                      skills) will often remain in the culture of poverty be it dropping out or
                      graduation. The steps out and up are just too far apart.</p>

                      <h2>The Battle Against Poverty of Mind</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>It is correct to say that Poverty of Mind is rooted in lack of Non
                      Cognitive Skills.</p>
                    <p>An example of poverty of mind is inability to have an expensive lunch with
                      an internship company CEO. Out of fear of not knowing <strong>EVERYTHING!</strong> from
                      how to get a table to when to order, or even if it is OK to just have the
                      cute little bagel and focus on the questionnaire. Lunch, if not impossible,
                      can be impossibly terrifying.</p>
                    <p>There is no breaking out of poverty when every-step induces fear,
                      confusion, anxiety.</p>
                    <p>To be clear, the ultimate aim for both Student and Principal. Almost
                      always, is to rise and break away, become a CEO.</p>
                    <p>Become an inspiration and a teacher; to make life more. To then retire come
                      the Golden Age of Wisdom and write. Write about the lessons that counted to
                      make them last even longer. Create an Audio Book in your own voice in hopes
                      of it being used 50 years from now to Rise &amp; Learn to Really Learn. What an
                      Honor to have your spirit revived by means of Admiration and Love, your own
                      voice across decades, maybe centuries, maybe forever.</p>
                    <p>Instead, the children are getting scared, mostly because they can see
                      schools are forcing irrelevant learning that fades away. It is impossible
                      to retain irrelevant knowledge. In context of education, forcing irrelevant
                      knowledge and grading a student down for lack of retention is evil.</p>
                    <p>And here the child does not want the job because it has too many
                      complications, can&apos;t even have the internship lunch because it is too
                      terrifying, and can&apos;t conceive of the notion of connecting with the CEO in
                      such a way as to eventually resign position and start a company in a
                      similar sector.</p>
                    <p>They are scared, sometimes crushed, but far too brave to show you...
                      Principal.</p>
                    <p>We know what happens to most young people that can&apos;t handle fear or
                      depression.</p>

                      minds, and young minds especially, is just another monster.</p>
                    <p>A school must become a place of healing before it can hope to teach.</p>
                    <p>It must protect against all kinds of poverty, and bad parents, dangerous
                      culture and bad ideas.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Focus on Real Education, not Administration. If you need money, then look
                      to your students.</p>
                    <p>Become a Start-up Accelerator. Give them initial mentoring and funding,
                      Take a small percentage of their earnings in return for the initial funding
                      and in order to fund other start-ups. Take only for a small number of
                      years, and only what you need. Get out of their way.</p>
                    <p>Never forget, Principal. You serve The Kids, The Students, they are the
                      point of it all, they are the future. The Children are not your means to
                      staying in business and getting paid- that would make you a Monster and a
                      Fraud.</p>
                    <p>The best way to fight poverty in a person&apos;s mind, is to set a student up
                      for a job so high up, that it will make them want to run out of the school
                      quietly-yelling and hope they never need to come back.</p>
                    <p>A prestigious position at a local Hospital as a Research Nurse that keeps
                      everyone informed a month ahead of time, a complicated job at the Library
                      of Congress, or as Someone Amazing at the Detroit Institute of Arts.</p>
                    <p>Set a step so high, that it is already a healthy career but completely
                      unreachable to the child, the step up being, Just Impossible. And then
                      slowly, build. But smaller steps, and maybe even smaller, or maybe even an
                      on-ramp for a smooth ride.</p>

                      we are, we are not machines that can make room for knowledge on our
                      long-term storage drive. Even with a blooming ecosystem of Memory Palaces,
                      that which is irrelevant to out Hearts and Existence will be soon forgotten.</p>

And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished. The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen. We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses.

                  <span class="text-muted">Startup Accelerators: There are two leading Startup Accelerators in US. Y Combinator and Techstars. Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>
