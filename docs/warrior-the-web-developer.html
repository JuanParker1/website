                    <p>Becoming a Web Developer is like fighting in a Great Battle.</p>
                    <p>If you make a wrong move, <strong>you will lose</strong>, but gain wisdom for it, with
                      each failure you gain more wisdom, with each rebuild, you build faster.</p>
                    <p>Things can get toxic all too quickly, you will have to be ready to quit,
                      and retry. Like a Samurai, without thought, you release your Katana, cut
                      the job, move on.</p>

                      <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Below is the text from <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/services/themes/guidelines">Love building themes? Join the Theme Store
                        community at Shopify</a>, where website themes sell for $180.</p>
                    <p>(If you think you can handle this, go for it! Though, please note that they
                      are gently asking that you have a team, which could mean outsourcing, and a
                      budget for bug fixing. The platform for managing your outsourced team would
                      be <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> and <a href="https://slack.com/">slack</a>, this is doable you could even experiment
                      paying your developers via <a href="https://liberapay.com/">liberapay</a>)</p>
                    <p>Personally, I see that the posting below has too many restrictions. And if
                      your theme won&apos;t average 10 sales per month, they&apos;ll throw it out.</p>
                    <p>I don&apos;t know what their relationship is with <a href="https://github.com/topics/css">leading web design
                        frameworks</a>. I don&apos;t think they have a rational streamlined pipeline.
                      Because, what they call bug fixing is a massive undertaking requiring
                      <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/graphs/contributors">dozens of developers</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>The most widely developed foundation for themes, after many years of
                      development had <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse/monthly">60 issues</a> last month alone (November 2019).</p>

                      <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Shopify is the world&#x2019;s fastest growing commerce platform and we have no
                      plans to slow down! The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to
                      make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes
                      available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for
                      their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate
                      designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the
                      Theme Store.</p>
                    <h5 id="important-information-to-know-before-you-apply">Important information to know before you apply</h5>
                    <p>Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme Partner
                      application:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme
                        Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s),
                        and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner.</li>
                      <li>Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a
                        lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who
                        are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you&#x2019;ll need to
                        consider how you&#x2019;ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are
                        currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in.</li>
                      <li>Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect
                        potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the
                        Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s).</li>
                      <li>We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes
                        ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme
                        Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way
                        during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with
                        you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack
                        channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your
                        theme-related questions and issues.</li>
                      <li>The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30. The Theme Partner
                        receives 70% of each theme sale.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5 id="what-to-submit-when-you-apply">What to submit when you apply</h5>
                    <p>Please email themes@shopify.com and include all of the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>A link to an active Shopify website you built for a client. This must
                        be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client.</li>
                      <li>A case study for the above Shopify website that details your
                        experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the
                        project and the client.</li>
                      <li>A cover letter.</li>
                      <li>A link to your design portfolio.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>For the <strong>active Shopify website</strong> our review will cover:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is
                        visible).</li>
                      <li>Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme
                        from the Shopify Theme Store).</li>
                      <li>Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall
                        originality).</li>
                      <li>Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space,
                        responsiveness, grid, and alignment).</li>
                      <li>Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text,
                        number of fonts used, and legibility of text).</li>
                      <li>Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page).</li>
                      <li>Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets).</li>
                      <li>Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart
                        pages).</li>
                      <li>Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website
                        functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For the <strong>case study</strong> we will be looking for you to provide this
                      information:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What brought the client to you?</li>
                      <li>What were the client&#x2019;s needs?</li>
                      <li>How did you go about solving their problem?</li>
                      <li>We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and
                        refining), and what you learned.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For the <strong>cover letter</strong> we would like to see the following information:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>An outline of who you (and your team) are.</li>
                      <li>Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community?</li>
                      <li>Why you think you&#x2019;d do well as a Theme Partner?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter. We
                      highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering
                      applications.</p>
                    <p>For the <strong>design portfolio</strong> we will be reviewing the same design related
                      points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Art direction.</li>
                      <li>Layout.</li>
                      <li>Typography.</li>
                      <li>Consistency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed
                      feedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we do
                      reach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will work
                      with you on the next steps of the approval process.</p>
                    <h5 id="your-theme-in-the-shopify-theme-store">Your theme in the Shopify Theme Store</h5>
                    <p>Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed via
                      the Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces
                      or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.</p>
                    <h5 id="theme-support">Theme support</h5>
                    <p>If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout,
                      dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a
                      timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may
                      be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.</p>
                    <p>Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their
                      theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme
                      documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.</p>
                    <p>Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25
                      sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping
                      their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved
                      standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements
                      to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.</p>

                      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up
                      struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the
                      30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into
                      the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.
                      Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under
                      active development, that is a lot of code updates.</p>
                    <p>There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with <a href="https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/submission-guidelines-themes-and-templates">more
                        reasonable restrictions</a>. Take a look at the sales stats that they
                      parade right at their <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">front page</a>. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,
                      the <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S">INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme</a> would have made 2.2 million USD.
                      Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.</p>
                    <p>Now remember <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S">INSPINIA</a> is sitting right on top of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> so
                      <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse">all this development is going on in the back</a> at no charge to <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers">INSPINIA
                        Developers</a>. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the
                      latest updates to the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> code base.

                      similar ways.</p>
                    <p>Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected to
                      wrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2
                        Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales ([3rd party sellers earn

                    </header>
                    <p>Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even
                      about learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;
                      because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).</p>
                    <p>It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a
                      Founder, a CEO.</p>
                    <p>You shouldn&apos;t think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for
                      the web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference
                      between $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an
                      employee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.</p>

Y Combinator: Website &#xB7; Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos What is Y Combinator? How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman &amp; Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture) Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few. YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference Fundraising Advice from Female Founders The Most Important Decision is Getting Started &#x2013; Laura Behrens Wu Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference Techstars: Website &#xB7; Techstars on YouTube What is Techstars? What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot; Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it. It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success. Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale. Squarespace or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website. Wrap Bootstrap: User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready. Parse, because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: https://parseplatform.org/ Danger: Learning Programming to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy the pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own deadlines. Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that&apos;s right - lead your team to victory. Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups. List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet. Profit Hunt (a play on Product Hunt) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). </span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett: English political leader, activist, writer and feminist icon. Known as a campaigner for women&apos;s suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until 1919 she led Britain&apos;s largest women&apos;s rights organisation, the National Union of Women&apos;s Suffrage Societies. The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.: Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop, and often block traffic. If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want to do their job, go home, and get paid. If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job and go watch some TV. You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&apos;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot; and you&apos;ll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you&apos;ll struggle to remember where it all started and what the battle was for. Because The Battle Is Not For You: The battle is for those that come; after you. In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the same. In long term, you help the world grow, it won&apos;t be your world, it will be the world of the future. The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education are two separate things. It will make you tired. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood. Bad News: There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too low. Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education, the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot; grades, making your parents happy. Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never looking back. Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue. Henry David Thoreau: I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms... The Good News: Real Education, is not about getting really educated. It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health. Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is not a healthy life. Faith of the Heart Article One: Inherent Dignity, Nobility.: The first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility. No one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or vacation, or else. You are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you are to rage, to rage against the dying of the light. Self Education starts With Life Changing Books: Best way to understand a book, is to listen to the Author reading it. And the best way to listen to a book, is while climbing a great mountain.
