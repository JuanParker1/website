learning slowly in many stages.
I begun in 1999,
and I am still learning new things about design.
All the programming languages changed many times,
but knowing the whole history is very useful at times.
I&apos;ve learned a lot from the command line,
to art, colors, design, and how to reach the finish line.
I am surprised how long it all took,
but with all I know I am sure I could write a whole book.
I still have to learn a bunch of stuff,
but it is not going to be very tough.
I mostly have to get all the colors, and glows to dance and blend,
I kind of left all the fun stuff for the very end.</span>

sitting with presidents and dignitaries,
let them smile that each passed their trial.
But you, Dear Mother, you take your child to the Library,
make it their Castle, make it their Home,
make it their Temple of Knowledge.
&quot;My Mother used to bring me here almost every day,
this is my Temple of Knowledge, this is my Forever Home.&quot;
Teach that non-fiction, especially Memoirs,
are the only safe way to grow up.
Keep them on a path to understanding of the simplest things first,
and the most important things second so that they may build an easy on-ramp for themselves.
Remind them, that all young mistakes have already been made countless times,
that all the lessons, answers, and hopes of prevention,
are to be found in sacred stories of Triumph and Disaster.
That there is little in blind following.
And that there is Everything in pursuit of Wisdom,
to join with the Greater Family of the Great Human Beings,
that came before us and are sure to follow.
That school is just a Dream,
of a Simpler Universe,
a melody sweetly played,
but not in tune.
That our mind at its most responsible,
is the Sole Institution that we require,
for Pursuits of Excellence and Higher Learning.
So as long as we love ourselves,
as long as we are compassionate to ourselves,
we can comprehend inside out, many times the knowledge,
of those who are taught, outside in.
Let the Temple of Knowledge,
shine its beacon and sound the bell,
each time the little ones need answers,
and each time they are ready to commit their own wisdom to History.
World Peace requires,
that each child today,
becomes a Great Being,
in the Greater Tomorrow.
World Peace has little to do with the unobtainable ceasefire today,
and has everything to do, with letting children grow up under blue skies,
without drone strikes, deafening echoes of explosions, bullet riddled walls, and detention camps.
May the Greatness of Your Vision, and Unbreakability of your Heart and Mind,
help the Unstoppable Children of today, become the Great Beings the Future Needs.</span>

that change requires,
that you and I grow.
That we grow in strength,
that we grow in experience.
that we grow in knowledge.
That we grow in Wisdom,
that we grow in Foresight.
That we grow all the way up.
We can&apos;t afford expensive Universities,
we don&apos;t even have the time.
We don&apos;t really want to graduate from Brown,
or Harvard, or Yale.
What we really want, is to spend a semester at each,
and for our hard earned wisdom to count as much as their Curriculum and GPA.
It would be nice to give a graduation speech,
though, it wouldn&apos;t last for very long,
everyone is so busy on that day.
And what a drop in the ocean,
a few years will seem come our Golden Age of Wisdom.
We have to be heard, BEYOND, a mere graduation speech,
and we have to learn FAR BEYOND anything a class can teach us.
We can&apos;t afford to be students, not for a year, not for a day,
because we are born at a gallop, and onward; to become an unstoppable force of Nature,
AND CHANGE, Meaningful Change.
That means, your little High School poetry book,
makes it into the back pocket of Every High School Troublemaker and Dropout.
And they will rely on your Down To Earth Greatness, and Your Unlimited, Unconfined, Hard Earned Wisdom,
to get through their nights, and to cross to the hills,
and to begin their Unlimited Journey to Their Mountain Tops.
There isn&apos;t time for classroom experience,
there is only time for Wisdom, Love and a Meaningful Contributions.
Every new intellectual,
each new dreamer, poet, writer or orator hoping to help the world grow,
needs a far greater audience, and a greater runway for a greater wisdom,
than any University can provide.
The changes cannot come from the Policy Makers, or Impressive Dignitaries, or Inspired Professors,
they can only come form deep within each and every Human Being alive today, and all those that are yet to come,
standing - on their own - in relentless pursuit of Excellence and Wisdom, not Grades, or Prestige.
We don&apos;t need more laws, more prisons, talking heads, and deans,
we need to take to the audio books, video lectures, the internet,
and learn at a speed far greater than any curriculum can offer.
Begin recording your first audio book,
listen to what you know,
and where you need to know more.
Pull yourself up by your own shoelaces,
let Unrestrained Education take over.
Wisdom graded by the lives you touch,
by the disasters you avert,
by the wisdom you share.
Let us set fairy tales aside,
and let us accept responsibility for our own education.
And encouraging all we meet to do the same,
there can not be a greater Brand Name,
than a Wise Humanity.
The world needs our help,
it is a call far beyond what Universities can point us towards to.
The world needs all... the Humans to Graduate.
From the upcoming politicians with their over-inflated campaigns,
and research that relies on low education and short foresight of the voter.
To those of us, who didn&apos;t want to go to MIT, or Harvard,
because we felt it only hold us back, if not downright break our heart.
Universities are little promises meant for a smaller and happier world,
the world of today is far too big to be moved by mere graduates,
even if it was all the universities trying all at once.
Every Human Being requires an Outstanding Education,
one that empowers them to stand up against all the wrong in the world today.
With the light of Intellectual Inheritance worthy of The Noblest Independent Human,
and the light they themselves bring to the world come their Golden Age of Wisdom.
My Dear Reader,
may you learn, and piece together so much wisdom,
as to ignite a light so powerful that each and every child in the word,
from across all political borders and language barriers will visit you and listen,
and grow in wisdom with your lesson and enlightenment.
Let us part part with the idea of an exclusive University and brand name education (whatever that is),
and take to every book worthy of each of us,
and learn more, and faster,
and greater lessons than can be taught outside in.
Because today&apos;s challenges are greater than the solutions that anyone in particular can bring,
the solution is in all of us, reaching and mastering knowledge and wisdom one by one.
The Protection of The Younger Generations from War, Poverty and Greed,
is the first and foremost, and must come as a result of a Wiser Humanity.
World Peace, and Human Rights,
are close second.
The Human Mind and Life is Too Sacred,
for little fairy tales of exclusive education.
Do not wait to be taught,
learn, and learn to no end in sight,
and when you know enough, share; and teach.
And may each Human Being,
grow to know that Wisdom, Growing All The Way Up, Greatness,
is neither optional, nor meant for the lucky few.
Let us accept the responsibility for Outstanding Self Education,
because for the world to grow; it is either all of us, or none.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Where, sometimes, we all belong,
and where life is very, very, very, very, long.
As it winds along the well worn paths like a little song,
and where there is always a right, that can fix a wrong.
And we are hardly ever alone, so as long as we stand strong,
and you can achieve anything so as long as your effort is lifelong.
Many others traveled all these sandy roads,
many handled much more weight and greater workloads.
But it really all revolves about how much you learn, love, and know,
that&apos;s what helps you get unstuck from that rainy office window.
We don&apos;t have to ride every crazy rodeo,
live beneath an angry grumbling volcano.
Run as if chased by herds of stampeding buffalo,
and like every corner hides a foe.
Beautifully... it is best to live life slow,
in tune with crickets, starry nights, frogs and rain, sunshine, and snow.
Live so slow as to have time to learn, think, and write,
to share with others all that you found to be lovely and bright.
And not knowing what to write about, is the best,
because that means Nordhouse is calling you, to a little quest.
And when you return, you will have to find a warm and cozy nook,
grab a mug of chocolate and let your poems flow into your litte book.
Yup, you may need to pack a back pack, and give it a go,
remember, life is longest, when you live it slow.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">When you gather a comfortable amount of observation,
there is a moment when you go from observer to creator.
It is similar to how you arrive in a new city,
at first you are unsure, but eventually it becomes your home town.
In politics, politicians so through something similar,
but it is a mistake, they become comfortable around manipulators,
and get comfortable with manipulating, propagating the blight.
In the world of books, the authors that resonate with you,
become your friends, Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Dan Brown,
they become family and you get to know them in your own way.
In world adventures, it is called going native, or emanating mana,
one moment you are an outsider, and the next you are riding a bull to work,
where you spend your days working hard on digging new wells,
hurrying to finish before your visa expires and you have get back to the loud and filthy city.
When knowledge becomes internalized, it becomes wisdom,
you become able to synthesize more knowledge out of what you already know,
some call it Enlightenment.
It all cases, it is natural, human, simple and easy to get to,
it is not rare, it is not a power granted only to special people,
it is a power that makes people more special.
If you read enough audio books that move you in the same direction,
you&apos;ll go from listening about something to becoming a participant in thinking about it.
It is a feeling so powerful at first,
that some become convinced they are geniuses,
and have deeper knowledge
&quot;Nope! that&apos;s just your first tipping point dude,
keep going though, because you are just about as amazing as you think you are, don&apos;t stop learning&quot;.
The more tipping points, and plateaus,
upon which we rests as we move towards the sunny parts of our mountain range.
The more capable we become, the more we can synthesize,
and the more of the things we synthesize slowly do become unique and amazing.
Finally, the more we know,
the easier it is to understand other people&apos;s works,
we begin sharing more and more with other creators.
That&apos;s Real Education,
we become specialists in our own unique corners of the world,
Eventually we too get stung by the urge to share what we know,
both the unique little discoveries or contributions we made,
and in memoirs that describe all the twisty little passages that got us there.</span>
