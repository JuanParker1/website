                  <span class="text-muted">I am sorry my Friends,
but life is not to be lived quietly.
If you are not shaking, and you voice is not broken, from screaming an yelling at the Congress,
when they called you in for questioning - but they had to drag you out,
for screaming - about the disgrace of insider trading, and corruption.
Because you couldn&apos;t keep yourself from being a bright dying star,
out of the potential they held to inspire and move, and educate generations.
If you aren&apos;t standing at the Diag, making the moron that was just there shaking with anger,
because you took his microphone, and you started quoting Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Dennett, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali,
Because it is just enough of evil for that particular day,
and you would, save the sunset by bringing in the Saints.
And if you never painted you car pink, especially the interior, because the Pepto Bismol didn&apos;t work,
and you had nowhere to go and noting to eat, but forward and a bag of stale old chips.
Because you couldn&apos;t put the books down,
for all the Love and Wisdom in there.
Why Henry went into the woods at Walden,
and what happened to Gregor Samsa in Metamorphosis,
and how beautifully Will Durant opened his Story to Philosophy,
&quot;Grow strong, my comrade &#x2026; that you may stand
Unshaken when I fall; that I may know
The shattered fragments of my song will come
At last to finer melody in you;
That I may tell my heart that you begin
Where passing I leave off, and fathom more.&quot;
My Friends,
we are not to live quiet little lives,
because we only get one each.
And the way to turn the volume up,
is to inherit wisdom from all the great beings,
at all cost at any cost,
because without their light we can&apos;t tell where we are going.
Get you audio books ready,
and listen, just learn,
listen to all those lives.
All those great beings,
are sharing lifetimes of wisdom with you.
Endure.
Listen.
Teach.
Move Mountains.
Make History.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">By the time you realize how true it is that the world is yours,
all the authority figures you once knew, will have retired.
So in teenage days, just as teachers are brainlessly trying to convince everyone,
that we are not good enough because we don&apos;t listen, or because we are failing their questionable curriculum.
We actually need to take a step back,
and find a way to learn for real.
Because even if, we don&apos;t waste, a single day,
real life will do a pretty good job at overwhelming us anyway.
You need to be learning hard,
with your friends.
You need to be learning,
from Lectures, Documentaries, Audio Books, Maker Shops and Hacker Spaces.
You need to be learning how to build real businesses,
that have a long lasting impact on your community, and maybe the world.
For those of us who aren&apos;t going into cozy Science or Medicine,
we need to come out of High School fists up, fighting, and swinging and kicking.
Because it is not college that should follow High School,
college is something you do for entertainment.
Taking late classes to unwind,
and sharpen your memorization and concept mapping skills.
After High School, you need to put an A-Team together, bitchy parents included,
and cross the Appalachian Trail, and keep in mind, that you may become a regular hiker.
After High School,
your first and only aim, is to find a reasonable path to Greatness.
Do you hear me,
My Friends?
Greatness... because everywhere else,
somehow, unforgivably, may just lead right back to the start.
You just don&apos;t know what it is going to be like when you return,
but you will be part mountain goat, part wild person that comfortably sh*ts in the woods.
And what is more, my friends, you will know, that should life ever challenge you,
you will be able to handle it, with Heart and Soul, with Wisdom, Humor and Grace.
There is not a moment to waste, there is not a day to pass,
make everyone of them count, and then help others to their own paths.
Remind your younger generation,
that they are not to lead sleepy lives of mild discontent.
You are the future, you are wisdom that the world needs to survive,
you are the leaders that are all the Hopes and Dreams of the past generations,
and your rightful stance in life, is that of a Great Being, and nothing less.

                  <span class="text-muted">At first they laughed, then they called them a cult,
then accused them of corruption, and when it was all over,
most called them The Founding Mothers.
We didn&apos;t live under a threat of Nuclear War,
the models predicted the war as 100% certain.
This is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,
Mutually Assured Destruction.
It didn&apos;t take computer models,
it didn&apos;t require an imagination,
war only needs time, guns and borders.
For uneducated humans, war is a certainty,
war is where we all come from.
The models predicted that it would take decades,
nearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.
One of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,
when we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.
When the world connected,
accepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.
The threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,
but leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.
Abandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,
can only occur on generation by generation level.
The generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,
and a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.
No abrupt changes could be made without conflict,
out of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.
And so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,
The League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.
And the Universe,
did smile.
The models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,
would result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.
The most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,
the probability of nuclear war approached 100%.
And as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,
set off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.
The weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,
was going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).
Volunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,
and the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.
Celebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,
to create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.
A number of authors donated their works to the school,
students participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.
By 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,
because it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.
The school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,
and as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.
A new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,
that decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.
These seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,
were achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.
Providing superior education to the children of a nation,
whilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,
is a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.
Rather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,
by participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity&apos;s most beloved books.
World Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,
to blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,
this was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.
We simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,
to the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.
The first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,
it was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.
The reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,
and meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.
It mattered not if it was two boys that Father Gregory Boyle was raising,
or two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.
Once they had access to wisdom,
reality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.
The League of Extraordinary Ladies didn&apos;t stop at Nuclear Disarmament,
their granddaughters ended poverty.
They did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,
they ended poverty by means of poverty.
It was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,
distributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.
The adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,
if someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.
One of the untended features of this program was local pantry,
a feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.
The trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,
in such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.
It is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,
but it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.
We needed programs to help us talk to each other,
and cut out the middle men.
We needed programs that helped cities become more independent,
and stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.
And we needed to begin thinking in decades,
in centuries.
Because our problems, do not end with us,
and what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.
What was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,
given all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.

                  <span class="text-muted">I have searched for great beings,
because I wanted to learn about life.
And I found them,
they are not even rare.
Many are outspoken,
and all over the internet.
Though, far greater in person,
than they show to the public.
They walk among us,
quiet and collected, wise and inspired.
And I wish they could live forever,
because that&apos;s what our world needs.
But they are not going to be around forever,
and they don&apos;t want anything that we can give them.
Except for one thing,
us becoming great beings too.
My Friends, as wonderful and powerful as Wisdom is,
Greatness, Greatness, is what the world needs.
We have to stop accepting things,
just because we were born into them.
We have to stop being lead,
and become leaders.
You wan to know what The Meaning of Life Is,
well let me tell you.
The meaning of your life,
is to become a Great Being.
Everyone of us,
a Great Being.
That is the mistake we made,
we thought that greatness is rare.
But greatness,
is what the world needs of us to grow.
Take to the Books,
take to the audio books (they can&apos;t be easier, and adventure books are breathtaking),
maybe, narrate the classics, and share with the Little Ones.
Avoid everything that is trying to teach you outside-in,
and reach out to learn, to really, really learn, inside-out.
Don&apos;t memorize, don&apos;t seek grades,
just inherit wisdom from a hundred audio books,
and then listen to nine-hundred more, just to be sure.
Let us inherit wisdom from Humanity&apos;s most loved modern audio books,
and let us fill ourselves with knowledge from a thousand lives,
knowledge will grant us wisdom,
and then let us rise and become leaders.
Leadership and Wisdom,
will drive us forward,
to become Great Beings.
Let us do this,
not for Heroes but for Humanity and the future,
for each other.
The world will only become better,
when each of us, accepts the responsibility for becoming a Great Being.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">It felt so healthy to sit down to the first version,
the promise of creating a program that will change the world felt amazing.
They settled on trusty bare bones express,
and the first routes they put in were view and edit.
Carl Sagan once said, that if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,
you must first invent the universe.
Ward Cunningham the inventor of WikiWiki,
has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.
With just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,
in the most simplest way possible.
They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,
the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.
In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,
it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.
For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt
The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,
the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.
If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,
and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,
by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,
every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.
It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,
and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,
this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.
So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,
basically a blank Wikipedia.
So now came the big question,
which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?
They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,
after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.
And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,
cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city
This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.
and they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.
Adding user support had to come in next,
just like every city had a page, so did every user.
Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,
Alice and Bob.
Out in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,
and she named the malicious politician Mallory.
Alice and Bob represented computer programs,
they were chatbots.
However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,
they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.
The bots weren&apos;t really inspired by anything other than old MUD programs but there was a beautiful line of code,
that one of the leads always looked at, line 26 in a sample script of github&apos;s hubot.
The bots were special,
they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.
As a whole they already created a very simple,
but living simulation.
For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,
the bot actually got its information from Detroit&apos;s own weather service.
And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,
that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.
Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,
that made working on the system fun.
But by far the most special thing about bots,
was that they could be replaced by a real human,
by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.
In the next release of the program,
the girls focused on enhancing this feature.
A bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,
but when a real person took over for an account,
they could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.
Even in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,
that a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.
As with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,
but it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,
and in the end large cities would go online within weeks,
because it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.
Cosmopolis 2.0 was what got the attention of United Nations,
but that is a story for another time.
Personal Note,
Becoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,
it becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.
There is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,
that contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.
I recommend learning JavaScript, which is currently called ES2020, to actually execute a program you will need an interpreter.
Your browser has one built in, as JavaScript is the language of the web, look up how to open the web console in your browser of choice.
The industry standard for server-side JavaScript applications like our Imaginary Cosmopolis is Node.js,
if interested you can search for video tutorials to help you get started.
