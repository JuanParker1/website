it will take more, than just you and me.
You have to move an entire generation, or two,
and they need to be really moved, to follow you.
You have to speak out, to inspire,
send a Noble Message that everyone can hear and admire.
Fix schools, and end poverty, both at the same time,
this will help to prevent and stop most crime.
Reality is a fierce and powerful friend,
it is the only thing that drive blindness to a permanent end.
Look decades into future, make your aims many, but small,
and step by step go forward, to make your goal.</span>

You only get one life, and that whole life is your life.
The whole thing is yours,
but you also have to become,
Great Beings, Mountain Movers, and Mentors.
The little ones need it,
you have to teach them the height you rose to,
so that they may continue,
and not reset back to where you started,
where it all started.
Governments, Laws, Institutions,
Schools Universities and Constitutions,
are Nothing compared to Your Heart, Your Wisdom.
Without Heart and Wisdom, all the machines we created out of paper and paper clips,
and bureaucrats, and democrats, an all the lying rats,
it all turns against us, and we are sent back a hundred years.
Back to war, concentration camps, bullet riddled buildings.
By the powers of Universe we have access to all the future we want,
but to advance forward we must teach, because lessons lost,
come at a great cost, a cost to the little ones,
your daughters and your sons.
To Teach, we must become Wise,
to become wise we must Learn,
not merely age as if we are living in a cage,
you are free to grow.
Grow to see it all,
so that you may know gateway from a wall,
so that the children may stand on the shoulders of giants,
so that their future is that much closer.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">There was a little lady that figured out how to change the world,
all that is known, is that she wasn&apos;t very old.
She posted a single long video, that opened with &quot;I don&apos;t want to be a bother,&quot;
today, everyone just calls her, Mum or Mother.
She said that Democracies require educated voters to operate,
that without real education a Democracy can fill with hate.
&quot;A democratic majority consensus is a really big deal,
without a consensus a nation will always suffer and never heal.&quot;
She spoke of the blight of Fake Education,
she said it lasted long enough to bring her nation down into great desperation.
She said Politics were as fake as Education,
&quot;everyone role-playing and quite blind to the real needs of the nation&quot;
The video was several hours long,
it showed her computer programs and how they brought the world together to get along.
She showed how Nations can invest into the futures of their kids,
creating educational paths with rewards and bids.
Game companies inspired by her imagination,
built it all, her entire virtual nation.
Slowly one by one, cities around the word adopted her program,
to this day it is still true to the original diagram.
Today, marks the programs 500th release,
and we celebrate 500 hundred years of Her Wisdom and World Peace.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence are a fine method,
for resisting the overwhelming power of Cultural Indoctrination.
It is easy to trick ourselves that we know enough, that we will do enough,
but to test ourselves we only need to see if we can write a meaningful book.
But there is other trickery at play,
one that is related to the level of our knowledge, and the content of the culture we grow up in.
This is a more formidable problem,
thus the Thinking Tools are more complex.
Authenticity exposes weakness and lessons,
and The Culture of Pursuits of Excellence, sets us on an adventure of the lifetime.
The Problem of Knowing Enough.
We tend to make decisions that result in not what we wanted,
our intent suffers from not enough experience, knowledge and information.
A good abstract example of that,
is navigating dark woods.
Without a map we maybe headed in the wrong direction,
with a map; we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.
The more we know, the better we navigate,
a powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,
Memoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.
The Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.
Is in observations of the surrounding world,
and hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.
If we are taught a falsehood about the world,
we will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.
A good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,
teaching their children that the other is evil.
It is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,
we tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.
Let me give you an example,
that your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.
When we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,
even though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.
No matter what,
we still believed.
We saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,
we saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.
We saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,
some of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.
We accepted grades,
and we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.
We accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,
we still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.
In the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,
and finally noticed that a diploma didn&apos;t even guarantee a well-paying job.
Late on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,
but a source of regret, a force of erosion.
Many of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,
and never said a single bad thing about schools.
The tragedy of organized education,
is a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.
Now let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both
The Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.
Authenticity.
Accept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.
that&apos;s how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.
Next time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,
also ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.
Dignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,
now add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.
Often times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,
it means that we were purposefully misled.
With Authenticity in our Heart,
we get an extra moment to ourselves.
In context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,
you are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.
No longer will you feel compelled to cram,
because it will feel inauthentic.
After all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,
is not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.
Authenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,
because one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.
However, the price we pay for ease,
is that we don&apos;t really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.
Pursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.
You start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.
This is more challenging, than cramming for tests,
but this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.
The reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,
is the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.
If that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,
or a Startup Accelerator, or your own company from zero.
Then you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,
as you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.
Knowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,
and at a pace that helped you retain most.
Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence,
put us on a path to becoming Wiser Beings.
They will help you see in a world obscured by indoctrination,
or one that lacks real education.

                  <span class="text-muted">Writing is like the spinning top in Inception,
it is a way to self evaluate.
If you continue being unable to write,
then it means you are surrounded by invisible walls.
Being able to lay down your favorite thoughts on a piece of paper,
and helping to inspire or enlighten someone, is a sign of health and inner-freedom, and in some cases Greatness.
There are many styles of writing,
and many directions.
My style of writing is patterned after poems,
I write two sentences per stanza, if I need a third sentence,
then it generally means I over-complicated something.
I think my favorite aim is to turn my little poems,
into little movies and stitch them together into a tiny documentary.
I&apos;ve heard of a project called Love Letters to Strangers
and I find that to be the sweetest aim of all.
In the larger scope,
we must all write to update the surface for future generations to stand on.
The books our parents read are great, by they are a bit old fashioned,
we have to, rebuild the library for the future generations.
We don&apos;t want the future to start with our parents,
we want them to start where we left off,
so that we may spare them the aches we went through.
Things change.
When we talked about climate 50 years ago,
there was still a chance to become educated about it and make informed decisions, today.
But, today, all we got is the observation that climate appears to have become more unstable,
and most are not educated enough to make any sense of it, or agree on any solution.
And that the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife is last 50 years,
people are too desperate for food, money, housing and health, to grasp what that means.
We need a new perspective on dealing with climate change,
because a world uneducated on the subject,
is a world that will never reach a consensus, and may never do anything about it.
Writing a book will tell you if you have the knowledge you think you do,
there are many teenagers, that feel they have mastered Quantum Physics; bless their Great Hearts and Beautiful Minds.
However, they can only write an assay or two,
they can&apos;t synthesize new ideas to fill a book.
Feeling smart is a very healthy sign, that a person is headed in the right direction,
but writing a book is a sign that they have traveled a considerable way there, and are of great health.
You can see what it means to be able to write a book much more clearly in this example in particular,
it means Freedom and Power of Mind, falling short is just... Dreaming.
There is a very powerful kind of book, that perhaps is most important,
and only a young person, during their youth can write it.
Brilliant Teenage Minds that made some headway in life,
writing advice to their peers, that have unfortunately gotten stuck, or fallen.
Opening ones heart at a young age, is a very noble thing to do,
it is a sign of Great Beauty, Compassion and Grand Heroism.
Those books, must not be judged by adults,
their creators must understand not to judge their creative writing by adult standards.
Adults are not what they seem, for one;
and second the people who benefit from those books are teenagers themselves.
A person who is suffering early in their life,
is best helped by the words of someone who has recently managed to rise out of similar problems.
Our youth is the most formative period of our life. Even the smallest of pains spared,
or littlest of mistakes avoided will have massive and profound influence over us, come our middle age.
Write,
write when you are young,
write when you are growing up,
write when nobody seems to be listening.
Write in the face of Liars,
write in the face pretenders, fakers, manipulators, wannabes, and fake-it-until-you-make-it morons.
Write to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps,
write to become a beacon
write to become a light of enlightenment.
Write to bring back what has been written a generation before,
if the story is worth the while, retell it, retell it countless times.
And when you are ready to lay down your pencil for the day,
read, read it out loud, and record it,
because the light in your voice is worth a million books.
And finally,
know what it is all for...
It is how the next generation learns from the previous one,
it is how they win the wars we could only hoped to have won.
It is how they become the heroes we hoped to be,
it is how they save the world, that we can&apos;t see.
Write, because that&apos;s how you! become the hero you hoped to be,
and because the world belongs to the future generations,
not just you and me.
Write.
