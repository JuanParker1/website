                  <span class="text-muted">Surely, this is a very mild winter season,
and Spring will come a month sooner just for that reason.
Therefore, we are really just about 84 days away,
it is coming real fast even though today the sky was gray.
And since this was an extremely warm year,
we can be certain that Spring really is near.
I&apos;d say we are looking at just about 54 days in total,
and this is hard evidence, not at all, anecdotal.
But you know, as well as I do too,
that this Spring will be a meteorological breakthrough.
So all in total, give or take a day,
I think Spring is just about 24 days away.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Wisdom has many names and can be viewed in many different ways,
most popular perspective is that [non-academic] Philosophy leads to wisdom.
One particularly beautiful view,
hints on wisdom with the words Content of Character.
The most mechanically sound description is,
understanding new things by subtle analogy to what we already know.
The most concerning view states that,
without wisdom we will be making mistakes.
I think most reasonable view; is all of the above,
plus knowledge gained from Adventure, Philosophy, and Science Books and Audio Books.
What is it for?
Why, it is our Operating System.
PART II, Thought Experiment
Allow me to share with you a thought experiment,
a way of seeing things that aid in your view of the world.
Without wisdom, we form tribes and elect leaders, shamans, or popes,
and hire muscle, creatures of violence.
Because that is the same thing the other tribe is doing,
and the weaker one will be destroyed with great horror.
These tribal bare bone behavior did not end in middle ages,
as one would hope.
This behavior is the default human behavior for the frightened and uneducated,
the desperate, the angry, even the sick.
We may not understand why criminals do the things they do,
but we can imagine one of our family members, who one by one loses everything.
And on the last day, when all he has left,
is an ounce of sanity, and a beating hart, he will fight, steal, and hate just to live another day.
And for those who can&apos;t imagine why one would like to live another day when it is all pain,
to persevere memories, to keep the fallen alive.
And here we meet a Man of Honor,
a Judge, along with a jury, and wealthy lawyers in fantastic shoes.
And all they see is a mad man,
a criminal, a man who needs to be put in a cage.
The Judge is wrong,
when it comes to putting people in cages, all judges are wrong.
To restore this man, he needs a home, and books, and friends,
and an education, and hope, and reams, and free money, and free food.
He needs to be treated with love and dignity,
and granted an opportunity to persevere his memories in a book.
There are no criminals,
they are just broken children.
The ugliness of the worst of them is just an act,
they just want to be left alone.
And I suppose that evil men do exist,
but I don&apos;t think there is enough of them in the world to fill a single prison.
The 10,000,000 people we keep in cages,
are just children with severe developmental issues.
There are no political systems advanced enough to treat these beings,
their only hope is the Public Defender.
The Public Defenders will fight to keep the broken people out of prison,
because they know prison will only make them worse.
If you ever wanted to see a real Angel,
ask a Judge to let you sit in on a court case, look that tired being in the eyes.
We are Human Beings,
we are not animals to be kept in cages.
I have met snarling beasts,
and I saw their red faces and bulging eyes, and they were just broken kids.
At first I wanted my older self to come and help me,
but later I just started calling them My Bullies, they never had a chance at a good life.
And here we find a sliver of sanity,
because there is something that can be done to control crime.
It is preventing children from being forced into that desperate mode of existence,
PREVENTION.
Prevention is a simple thing, Free Home, Free Food, Free Money,
and Free Tutors, a Real Education.
It will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,
it is as simple as that.
No suffering,
no harm.
And for those of you who are crazy enough to ask who will pay for this,
let us call the institution a Bank of Love, right at the Heart of a Country.
They print only as much money as people need to be taken care of,
and they pride themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.
Prevention, is really about education,
because an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.
Social Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,
will grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can&apos;t pay for extras.
They&apos;ll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,
but not the boat.
Prevention will go a long way to bring the number of prisoners down,
these desperate beings are part of our family, it is all of us or none.
We are a young civilization,
we don&apos;t have governments that can handle Universal Basic Income.
We have governments,
that can barely handle themselves.
We can cross this bridge, the bridge where we eliminate poverty, and homelessness, and immense fear and suffering,
suffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don&apos;t burst out of pain.
To get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,
those of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.
Only in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,
beyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.
The youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,
but you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.
Treat the cause,
and the symptoms will subside.
Only in wisdom,
can our civilization advance forward.
Personal Note,
Those of you who are just learning about the world,
know that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.
Be it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,
they are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.
We are still building the foundation,
and we are getting too much interference from our leadership.
Look no further than the complete loss of privacy,
this is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.
Enhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,
the world has no faith in nations that practice torture.
The 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full
it reads &quot;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States&quot;.
You have a lot of work on your hands,
and you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.
While you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,
read them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.
In less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,
you will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.
It is in it self a great adventure,
and if I may, a Memoir is best written as your life unfolds, it is never too early to start writing.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Lack of education must be recognized as the highest threat,
to the security of our world.
We are not to force children into poverty,
by selling a mere impression of knowledge.
Privacy is to be recognized,
as a Basic Human right.
And those of you who hate, or just laugh,
know in no uncertain terms, that you will be forgotten.
The younger generations are sacred,
and they are to be honored by free and effective education.
They are to be granted privacy,
free acres to any and all educational materials and all books, including audio books.
Those of you who are looking to turn a profit,
by dangling education as a carrot, will be forgotten in disgrace.
Rest of my note,
is for the Children.
Know that parents are often victims to their cognitive biases,
out of lack of education, out of never having met a real teacher.
Know, with all certainty that borders are wrong,
they are a symptom of poison that our biases drive into us when unchecked.
The effects of our cognitive biases burn brightest and spread fastest,
when fueled by lack of education; poverty of mind and wallet.
The world of today is choking on chaos born from lack of education and wisdom,
prestigious positions are taken up by lying pretenders whose only aim is to fake it until they make it.
They are unaware of their lack of education,
they do not know what wisdom is, most of them just want to feed to no end.
Only in wisdom can the world become what it is mean to be,
one home, for us all, our entire family.
We are only divided by levels of education,
in Wisdom we are one, and we are each Unique and Infinitely Beautiful.
You are not so serve, you are the future,
you are to lead the world to unity and wisdom.
In poverty certain imaginary things spread in our minds like viruses,
they are fueled by fear, darkness, uncertainty and lack of education.
They become a beacon to those who like to frighten,
and take enlightenment away with threats punishment for no other reason than to tower and feed.
It your great responsibility to set yourself free,
do not be a slave to a cult.
You are meant to become a Wise Being by listening to and reading books,
and you are meant to become a Great Being by helping your loved ones and even some of your enemies towards enlightenment and freedom.
If a school is not teaching you,
then it is not a school, and you have to find a real one.
Do not become tricked by a mere impression of education,
you don&apos;t need a job, you need to be a business owner, and a leader.
We need you to stand as competition to overpriced medicine and companies that violate human rights for profit,
to corporations that cannot have hearts and slick talking psychopaths, who will never see value in helping you.
Especially those who announce themselves with,
with bite sized lies.
Build you own schools out of books,
may you share libraries.
May you build schools free of shame, judgment, pressure to cheat, and threat punishment,
or prison - which is what being held back is.
Share your wisdom amongst each other,
tell the world about your parents in audiobooks and torrents of videos.
Question poverty, question profit maximization,
and the betrayals of privacy, leadership, and even organized education.
The internet is for you to connect and see that we are all the same,
we all love your humor, and relish in and learn much your insults.
The internet will remain in place as we all wait for you to connect the world together,
we built it for you and we will protect it until you make the borders that divide humanity, irrelevant.
We fill and re-fill libraries with inspiration and wisdom to help you grow faster,
to help you gain visions with clarity that is not available to us - and it is working.
Always reject status quo and question authority,
especially their biases and down to their marrow until all they have left to speak is, that ounce of truth they do know.
Without wisdom, desperate men can only blindly-and-automatically, repeat history&apos;s mistakes,
those who have no wisdom have no authority over you, YOU ARE THE FUTURE.
We are to make Audio Books out of Love,
not wars out of incompetence, fear and hate.
Happiness is not something you can pursue, that&apos;s impossible,
nor life is a journey to some imaginary destination, we can only return to the nothingness we emerged from.
Happiness must ensue, and it will only appear in lives of wisdom,
it is not a feeling can capture and hold, it is a gravity that will overwhelm and lovingly crush you every day, forever.
The road ahead of you, is extremely long,
and requires hundreds of years of work.
But the future is beautiful,
it is more beautiful than any of us alive today can imagine.
Take to audio books on the subjects of Adventure, Philosophy, Wisdom, Science, Greatness and Growing Up, immediately,
and take what you learn to school, do not let teachers trick you into cramming and blame it on you.
The world is standing still, the sooner you stand up for Wisdom and deliver,
the sooner the future will come.
You are the teachers now.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Greatness is not a question of having it or not,
it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.
We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,
to save the world from mediocrity and hate.
All battles for goodness are already won,
and before you know it, your great task will be done.
But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,
set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.
You never really fight in a good war,
the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.
But Greatness will call to you non the less,
it will ask you to speak about Wisdom, Love, Growing Up, and Kindness.
You see many Great Beings smile when facing wrath,
that powerful joy comes from the certainty of walking the right path.
Those who walk the wrong path, age quickly and fade,
and history books will soon-enough reveal their charade.
The Noble Greatness within us all is forged to last,
and the opportunities ahead are as beautiful as vast.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">Any adventure,
is an adventure.
You don&apos;t have to go far,
though walking will be involved.
Adventures within adventures,
are even more fun.
That&apos;s where you go somewhere,
and then explore something else from there.
It is like going to Ludington,
but then marching around Nordhouse Dunes.
Or visiting White Fish Point,
and then trying to find fossils on the beach.
Or even going to the mall with your friends,
and then just people watching instead.
One definition of tiny adventures,
is going somewhere and then learning something new.
But you see, in this modern age we live in now,
this is a lot more exciting than it sounds, because of Audio Books.
Though you maybe walking to the store for a change,
your Audio Book, may transport you to the Appalachian Trail.
There are other things that can spice up your adventures,
it all depends how creative you are.
For example, back in January 2014,
during the gorgeous -16 Fahrenheit Polar Vortex weather in Michigan.
With all the warnings as not to go outside,
and stay home, and drink hot chocolate.
I put on all my clothes, all at once,
and hurried out, for an hour-and-a-half-long expedition.
I wasn&apos;t in want for anything,
so I figured I might as well get some little beef jerky sausages.
It didn&apos;t seem as cold as everyone made it out to be,
but it did make my sausages; as frosty, as my little adventure fantastic.</span>
