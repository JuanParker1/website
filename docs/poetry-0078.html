                <p>Look,</p>
                <p>look at all those things that made you small.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Look how unimportant the inauthentic is,</p>
                <p>how fragile those words that upset you really were.</p>

                <p>And pay attention, to the real problem,</p>
                <p>how easily you were tricked and mislead.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>That cannot go on,</p>
                <p>you are not a push around.</p>

                <p>I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,</p>

                <p>How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,</p>
                <p>the acquisition of wisdom really is.</p>

                <p>Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,</p>
                <p>and what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>I don&apos;t think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,</p>
                <p>it is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,</p>
                <p>a Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,</p>
                <p>from now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,</p>
                <p>you will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,</p>
                <p>has anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p>Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,</p>
                <p>let them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.</p>
