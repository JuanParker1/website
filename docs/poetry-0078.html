                  <span class="text-muted">Each day always starts with getting up,
except that, in the little wilderness you can&apos;t just roll out of bed.
At first, at best, you roll over,
to see where everything is at.
And although you can kind of lift yourself,
you can&apos;t really get up.
You sleep on the ground,
in a little tent.
That means you can,
only! stretch one limb at a time, and only a bit.
A successful decoupling and release,
requires great gymnastics.
The first order of the day,
is always fire, and a food item if you got one.
The trick to starting a fire,
is to start with tiny twigs that matches can light.
And then you add bigger, and bigger sticks,
it is absolutely required that you do a little dance.
The second order of the day, is adventure,
so you set off immediately.
Bring a day pack a water bottle,
if you are not sure where you are headed, follow the seagulls.
In my case there is this fantastic out of place bench,
right a top a dune.
One of the odd things about it is that,
it is about a foot too high off the ground, due to dune erosion.
To get atop of it, you must hoist a knee, and then kind of desperately roll in to it,
with an intense expression, and you realize that you haven&apos;t done that since your terrible twos.
Upon basking in the sun, the next order in the day,
is troublemaking.
On that particular day, I&apos;ve noticed two weary travelers by the parking lot,
sniffing the leaves of a tree, that they were eagerly attempting to identify.
I briskly walked up to them and said,
&quot;Oh my god, you guys, this is poison ivy, don&apos;t touch that.&quot;
One of the older ladies started making chicken noises at her friend,
and I waddled away.
To, my surprise, I discovered that this parking lot held a water pump,
I had no idea.
The fourth order of the day,
is the venerable search for a walking stick to continue the walk about.
This is no easy mater at Nordhouse as you can&apos;t miss the:
&quot;THIS IS BEAR COUNTY&quot; posters printed in Bold Comic Sans all over.
Any venture into the woods could potentially result in a dangerous standoff,
between a snarling man and a beast.
The fifth order of the day, at least for me,
is fossil hunting.
I have my collection right next to me as I write this,
though they all look like gibberish to me, some of those thing are prehistoric.
Fantastic!
It is a long walk to my favorite spot,
but it looks like a dune valley where you are surrounded by pretty tall dunes.
And here I cheerfully waddle back,
with a pocket full of rocks.
Back to my camp,
eyes still searching for fossils.
In the early afternoon it is good time to set off for the gas station,
here I usually grab a sausage and a couple of gallons of water, maybe a candy bar.
And the day slowly nears getting some more firewood,
sharpening a stick for the sausage, and waiting for the sunset to come.
At Twilight I prepare my Audio Book for the evening,
and crawl back into my fluffy sleeping bag.

                  <span class="text-muted">The first point of failure,
and our first hope for repairs.
Is focus on real education.
Schools are graduating students that they failed to educate,
these children grow into confused adults, lost and looking for belonging.
Why is this tolerated?
Let me ask you,
what would happen if we asked all the College Graduates to re-take all their tests from high school on?
Shouldn&apos;t people who graduated college easily show improvement to their GPA when re-taking all their tests?
Shouldn&apos;t those who graduated, but can&apos;t pass their test,
ask for a refund, or a lawsuit for having been tricked into an impression of education?
It is tolerance of these simple stupid problems,
that leads to made up lives of fantasy and eventual blindness towards evil.
If you can&apos;t pass all the college tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated college,
then you do not have a college education.
If you can&apos;t pass all the high school tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated high school with,
then you do not have a high school education.
If you can&apos;t pass all the middle school tests and get a higher GPA than the one you left middle school with,
then you do not have a middle school education.
Not only that, but the way these schools teach and the knowledge they drive into you,
may not be useful; you may not even have a useful education.
I think we can all agree here,
that we have a problem.
At the very least,
if your child has bad grades, don&apos;t make them feel bad, or unintelligent.
You should move them to a different type of school,
where teachers are interested in educated children rather than turning them into a paycheck.
The reason why it does not occur to parents that schools are not working,
is that they don&apos;t have experience with fake institutions, they take them for granted.
They are indoctrinated into a culture where school is good,
and being a worker is great, and it takes a particularly awful person not to achieve anything in life.
So what are those achievements?
How is all that retesting going?
The problem, as you can imagine, is much larger,
tolerance of fake education is just the beginning.
Above all,
Humanity must grow.
We are not allowed to tolerate Human Right Violations,
all human beings are created equal.
All must be granted equal opportunity to real education,
in a world that sets them free from poverty, and helps their bodies stay healthy.
Nations are not allowed to oppress their people,
no one has that right.
Nations have a great responsibility to help them to a Real Education,
in ways that will ignite a life long adventure across all sciences.
An opinion cannot stand against a fact,
that is a sign of illness, a small disorder born from fake-education.
And our dignity is such, that we must help each other rise,
we are not to tolerate anything that tricks people into believing in options over facts.
Fake education has been behind every evil perpetrated on this planet,
it is very much like a virus, it does two things really well, it spreads, and it reinfects.
Whatever beliefs are too hard to let go of,
we only need to place them in history or fantasy books.
It is wonderful to ponder Ice Giants and Greats Serpents,
but only as a fairy tale, or part of our growing up, not as a fact of life.
Fake education, unravels us,
it erases great strides made by great beings, and pulls the younger generations into dark ages.
The fantasies that bring us calm,
unravel the minds of the younger generations.
The reason we search for mere calm,
is that we ourselves, have been tricked out of real education.
All these confusing questions,
are easily treated with made up fantasies.
But that also serves to defeat the purpose,
of having a Beautiful and Powerful Mind.
It makes us weak.
Not a single Human Being is allowed tolerate
Concentration Camps, Abuse, Child Abuse, Racism and Xenophobia, or Inequality, Hate, or Fake Education.
Those of us who chose to relegate ourselves to a life of fantasy,
must also leave the table of public discourse.
Those of us who trade with nations that employ torture,
are not allowed to hold political positions, they simply can&apos;t, it is immoral to tolerate this.
Anybody who is delays Humanity&apos;s Progress,
contributes to Human Suffering, to all Suffering, Blindness, Misery, War, and Torture.
Our minds are extremely powerful,
and as they are allowed to develop, we will find unity.
We will agree on everything,
as we stabilize amongst each other in wisdom.
Government wise, there are no great disagreements,
there is only steady progress, forward.
On the individual level,
it is not that different.
Stress and anger, and sadness yield to Love and Wisdom,
even tragedy turns around a little bit.
With real education, we don&apos;t fall to pieces because something beautiful ended,
but we celebrate that it existed in the first place.
In wisdom, we seek a different class of things,
Nobler Things that come about as a result of our sense of dignity and real education.
No longer does anyone go home to a TV dinner,
suffering from depression, and fear, and loneliness.
What creates an educated government, a real government,
is prevention of sickness and poverty.
Nobody goes home convinced they are a worker,
or terrified of Human Resources, or or an uneducated &quot;Boss&quot;.
There isn&apos;t anybody who will argue against free medical care,
or universal income, or national debt, let it pile up.
The greater the debt that nations of earth owe to the universe,
the higher our level of compassion, empathy and development.
Money is just a job tracking tool,
on the government level it exists as an abstract idea.
You don&apos;t have to worry about Government Debt,
it is a good kind of debt, and it has no collectors.
Do you see?
Fake Education,
is tearing this world apart.
Fake Education,
is halting its progress.
It is neutering our minds,
it is turning us into workers.
It makes us ask stupid questions,
and parade stupid ideals and fake political labels.
We can&apos;t have a world without real education,
the dark ages will swallow us through the various tax exempt churches and imaginary gods.
Irrelevant worthless opinions will have us fighting for nothing,
because they are all equally wrong, stupid, and useless.
My friends,
pay attention to fake education, and everything will work out in the end.
We will find out way to wisdom,
we will converge on World Peace in our Wisest and Noblest ideas.
All you have to do, is make it clear to everyone around you,
that you will not tolerate fake education, that you are not on that side of history.
Write, Rhyme, Paint, Tag,
find your way out of fake education and whatever else is pulling you away from wisdom.
Hold up you path, and show them the results,
so that others may choose follow.
Real Education is marked by wisdom,
and it shows real results and contributions.
And though your hard earned achievements may already be great today,
your work is not finished until it brings permanent or lasting contributions towards our eventual convergence on Peace and Wisdom,
Every Human Being on Earth matters,
they are our family.
If you accept this great endeavor, many who fell prey to fake education may hate you in their own sickness,
but their children and the children of their children will grow up in a world transformed, in no small part by you.
We are one people, we are all meant to be Truly Educated in Our Beautiful Minds,
and we are all meant to live in safety and in peace looking after one another.
We are one people.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">As winter nears,
and snow appears.
You need not worry,
it is not end of Summers&apos;s glory.
Simply, look at weather, in Florida Keys,
no doubt it will be 83 or more degrees.
Often Georgia is also very nice,
and it is not too far, and may suffice.
Don&apos;t let snow make you fell lonely or sad,
because things aren&apos;t that bad.
Plus.
There is a couple more reasons,
for one, the equator reverses seasons.
And two, there are people that walk from Georgia to Maine,
from early Spring to Autumn they hardly ever complain.
Those are the Appalacian Trail Hikers of course,
beautiful, powerful, and as strong as many a horse.
From Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin they walk,
crossing every mountain, valley, woodland, and rock.
So if Winter ever makes you feel sad,
then it is time for change, and you should be glad.
Because, wintry sadness is a universal call,
a call for adventure, that rings in us all.
Whether you are only going to drive to Georgia and back,
go all the way to the Keys, or start shopping for a backpack.
Growing up is something that people who love you, want you to do,
they know that to thine own self, you must be true.
Our lives are precious and we are not workers of any kind,
we are dreamers and thinkers and we are not meant to live blind.
You are at your most beautiful when you are Happy and Strong,
so grab your loved ones and have them come along.</span>

you will discover, the new moon.
While the day is full of light,
it is not over, till midnight.
Because, once your eyes get used to the night,
the moon and the stars, become almost as bright.
Though many, may count their sheep,
an adventurer need not yet go, to sleep.
Please, believe me, there are sights to see!
there is a second world out here, and night is key.
Aside from the occasional streak of silent owl,
you may catch a pack of coyotes, look up, and howl.
Some grasses by the beach glow blue,
static electricity can create a breathtaking view.
Over in the ocean all the glowing fish come out,
they look like stars, when scattered about.
And the moon does not glow, it carries a reflection of the sun,
the photons touched it, and now touch us, in their cosmic fun.
The trees take on a whole new life in the moonlight,
rich green fragrant watchers of your campsite.
The night in many ways is just as bright as the day,
if you have never been on an adventure... please don&apos;t delay.</span>

                  <span class="text-muted">When you drive long enough,
you will inevitably find yourself far away from everything.
Now, you have to be courageous,
as first few days are going to be filled with doubt.
Once you get through it,
and the daily stresses let go of you, you will become you.
And if you give it long enough,
you&apos;ll find yourself wondering how you got here.
The answer is almost always,
&quot;By making excuses for people, that didn&apos;t deserve them.&quot;
This falls back on judging people by that age,
and not by their wisdom, class, and maturity.
Anybody can age,
but the pursuit of wisdom is a great challenge.
Just as soon as you stop making excuses,
as you stop filling in the blanks, you are placed on a path towards wisdom.
While you do need your books,
and narrated books are best, the journey is also very important.
You can&apos;t hear the wisdom of a book,
until you get on that path.
And let me precisely state what that path is,
so that there is no room for confusion here.
It is,
The Path Of Adventure.
I was sitting in my coffee shop,
I went there because it once had Tolstoy on the bookshelves.
But, I&apos;ve noticed that things have changed,
and people were not growing up, they were running in circles, curving inwards.
I sat in the rocking chair,
it was the first time, it felt nice.
I rose,
and made it to Tennessee.
I could feel the Spirit of Adventure,
but there was this enormous responsibility to help people grow.
I was too young to be heard,
though I have a faint memory of someone calling me Mother Hen somewhere.
Georgia, I made it to Georgia next,
but instead of turning around, I slept at a rest area.
I woke up, and kept going,
until the highways I was on, turned to US Highway One.
I pulled up by the beautiful beach,
and I walked into the Amazing and warm Ocean.
Standing On The Edge Of The Universe,
I called it.
It was wonderful,
the stars came out, I&apos;ve noticed little glowy fishes swimming about.
On my way pack,
I shout right past my city, and kept on driving.
And yet again I ended up on another beach,
this time in Ludington, Michigan.
Here I overheard someone mention,
Nordhouse Dunes.
I set off immediate, I&apos;ve never seen dunes that big before,
they looked like mountains, to me.
I begun sleeping at a different campsite each day,
then I discovered a little dune that reminded me of a volcano.
And I have spent many days there,
I have listened to many audio books on top of my little volcano.
I discovered how much there is to wisdom,
and what is more, that most of our wisdom has to come from within us.
Daily stresses, and unimportant worries,
trying to speak to people who never listen, is not healthy.
Before we try to help others grow,
we must become wise, and much, much older.
People must be ready to listen,
before they can hear and comprehend what you are sharing.
Express your concern for others,
but not by being pulled into problems of people that don&apos;t listen.
Write, and narrate your books, write to those who are searching for wisdom,
and you will be heard and adored the world over.
Now, go set off on your beautiful adventure,
may you discover all the wisdom and fathom more.</span>
