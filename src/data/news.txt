2020-08-27T22:14:44.225Z | Dark UI and Usability | More UI updates, I ran a lot of tests and tested some tooling against <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>. In short Bootstrap is not yet ready for dark mode, the solution, I think is the best, is to add more colors, this time for backgrounds but they have so many developers and so many ideas they'll probably find some better way. My tools experimented with adjusting colors on the <a href="https://www.hsluv.org/" target="_blank">HSLuv</a> scale and pretty much worked but currently Bootstrap allows placing primary color on primary background and does not see anything wrong with the fact that both are the same color. Hence, my idea of having a separate theme palette with background colors, but all components that have backgrounds (buttons, alerts, drop-downs) would have to be rewritten to make use of the new separate background palette... better than automatically calculating it during compilation. Then simple tools could be made to generate backgrounds from primary colors. Like the one I made: <a href="https://github.com/catpea/catkin" target="_blank">https://github.com/catpea/catkin</a>.

2020-08-25T21:53:42.324Z | Default Colors | Ew, I had to switch back to default colors. I upgraded to Bootstrap 5 (was 4.5) and I found that the new code is much better for developing custom designs (they call it utilities api) but I ran out of time today, so just to be safe I will disable custom colors so that everything is readable and get back to creating color themes tomorrow.
2020-08-24T23:50:14.989Z | Updated News | Old codebase for <a href="https://news.catpea.com/">https://news.catpea.com/</a> has been retired now, it kept crashing everything, it crashed Chrome on my cheap phone and IceCat (Firefox Clone) on my Linux just now. Hard to say what it was, complexity, it just grew too big. There is a super-light poetry mirror under <a href="https://catpea.github.io/poetry/">https://catpea.github.io/poetry/</a> and that will always be up to date and accessible to legacy software and older phones. Yikes it is 8PM, I gotta go, it is time for my poetic musings.
2020-08-24T21:41:46.561Z | Early Launch | Things maybe broken for a few days, but almost everything works <a href="https://news.catpea.com/">https://news.catpea.com/</a> will be up and recent a while longer, it crashed Chrome on my cheap phone again, YouTube is still working great, but the poems may lag a bit. The best way to listen to latest poems is by going to <a href="https://catpea.com/">https://catpea.com/</a> and clicking listen on the individual poems. I tested multiple audio players and they all had problems. YouTube prevents automating uploads, and all the audio platforms are making it difficult or impossible. I can't combine all the mp3 files into one, because git hub may start complaining about huge new files being added daily (there is no delete on git/github) it is OK to add one poem, bit not all poems in one new mp3 file every day. YouTube can work, I would need to upload a lot manually, but I would have two playlists, so things would be updated daily, and all poems would eventually catch up. I got to ship/deploy the new website today test it live, to start clearing up my to-do, simplify everything and begin automating as much as possible.
2020-08-23T17:42:24.844Z | Website Upgrade | New Website, again. I am adding support for multiple books, including multiple virtual books that come from a single text repository. This is a very flexible system that should serve for many years.
