# Website
catpea.com website - just run build-all.sh

This is a proof of concept work-flow component, the server repository creates and holds a static mirror of a koa server, this repository pulls in that data for actual hosting purposes.
This design allows for safe testing prior to deployment, and ensures that only fully tested website is deployed.

Please note: the server repository is a new method for generating websites that work well with search engines, static hosts, and clients that do not use java-script. It is a simple an reliable system for complex and programmable data delivery.

## Notes
requres (warrior, poetry)+(server) with updated docs.
